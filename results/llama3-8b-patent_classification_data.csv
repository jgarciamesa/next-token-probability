The patent in question is titled Antibodies against and methods for producing vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus.  The extract of text citing that article is:  Generation of an F Peptide 
     F peptides can be generated by numerous means including but not limited to, chemical synthesis and recombinant protein expression. Soluble peptides can be expressed and purified from a host cell. In one embodiment, synthetic recombinant DNAs are prepared that encode an F peptide of the invention. 
     In another embodiment, synthetic recombinant DNAs are prepared that additionally contain sequence tags useful in facilitating purification of an F peptide. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the tag that facilitates purification of the F peptide does not interfere with its activity. In a specific embodiment, the tag amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc. 9259 Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, Calif. 91311). Other peptide tags useful for purification include, but are not limited to, the hemagglutinin â€œHAâ€ tag, which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson et al., 1984 , Cell  37:767) and the â€œflagâ€ tag. 
     There are a number of different approaches that can be used to express and purify soluble peptides. The DNA sequence of an F peptide may be manipulated using methods well known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences, e.g., recombinant DNA techniques, (see, for example, the techniques described in  Current Protocols in Molecular Biology , F. M. Ausubel et al., ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons (Chichester, England, 1998);  Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,  3nd Edition, J. Sambrook et al., ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 2001), each of which are incorporated herein by reference). DNA vectors encoding an F peptide are prepared and subsequently transformed into an appropriate expression host cell, such as, e.g.,  E. coli  strain BL21 (DE3), and the protein is expressed and purified using methods routine in the art. For example, expression of a gene encoding the peptide with a histidine tag can be ",0.97

     EXAMPLES 
     Example 1. Antitumor Efficacy of G207 in CT26 Cell Line 
     The antitumor efficacy of G207 was evaluated in a bilateral, established subcutaneous tumor model with CT26 cells as described below. 
     Cell Line 
     The murine colorectal carcinoma CT26 cell line has been widely used as a syngeneic tumor model to study immunotherapy. Fearon et al.  Cancer Res.  35: 2975-80 (1988); Wang, et al.,  J Immunol.  154: 4685-92 (1995); Huang et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA  93: 9730-35 (1996). CT26 is a transplantable colon epithelial tumor induced by intrarectal injections of N-nitroso-N-methylurethane in female BALB/c mice (H-2 d ). Corbett et al.,  Cancer Res.  35: 2434-39 (1975). 
     In normal mice, CT26 is poorly immunogenic: 10 3 -10 4  cells can cause a lethal tumor and do not induce detectable tumor-specific CTL. Fearon et al., supra; Wang et al., supra. AH1, a nonmutated nonamer derived from the envelop protein (gp70) of an endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia provirus (MuLV), env-1, has been identified as the immunodominant MHC class I-restricted antigen for CT26. Huang et al., supra. Adoptive transfer of peptide-specific CTL lines has been able to cure established subcutaneous CT26 tumors, demonstrating the correlation between induction of tumor-specific CTL and an antitumor effect.

The patent in question is titled Di-aliphatic substituted pegylated lipids.  The extract of text citing that article is: mpared to a species absent such a ligand. Ligands providing enhanced affinity for a selected target are also termed targeting ligands. Examplary ligands for conjugation to the lipids are targeting ligands. 
     Some ligands can have endosomolytic properties. The endosomolytic ligands promote the lysis of the endosome and/or transport of the composition, or its components, from the endosome to the cytoplasm of the cell. The endosomolytic ligand may be a polyanionic peptide or peptidomimetic which shows pH-dependent membrane activity and fusogenicity. In certain embodiments, the endosomolytic ligand assumes its active conformation at endosomal pH. The â€œactiveâ€ conformation is that conformation in which the endosomolytic ligand promotes lysis of the endosome and/or transport of the composition, or its components, from the endosome to the cytoplasm of the cell. Exemplary endosomolytic ligands include the GALA peptide (Subbarao et al., Biochemistry, 1987, 26: 2964-2972), the EALA peptide (Vogel et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.,  1996, 118: 1581-1586), and their derivatives (Turk et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 2002, 1559: 56-68). In certain embodiments, the endosomolytic component may contain a chemical group (e.g., an amino acid) which will undergo a change in charge or protonation in response to a change in pH. The endosomolytic component may be linear or branched. Exemplary primary sequences of peptide based endosomolytic ligands are shown in Table 3.

The patent in question is titled Cellulolytic enzyme compositions and uses thereof.  The extract of text citing that article is: o-1,4-(1,3;1,4)-beta-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase (E.C. 3.2.1.4) that catalyzes endohydrolysis of 1,4-beta-D-glycosidic linkages in cellulose, cellulose derivatives (such as carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose), lichenin, beta-1,4 bonds in mixed beta-1,3 glucans such as cereal beta-D-glucans or xyloglucans, and other plant material containing cellulosic components. Endoglucanase activity can be determined by measuring reduction in substrate viscosity or increase in reducing ends determined by a reducing sugar assay (Zhang et al., 2006,  Biotechnology Advances  24: 452-481). For purposes of the present invention, endoglucanase activity is determined using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as substrate according to the procedure of Ghose, 1987 , Pure and Appl. Chem.  59: 257-268, at pH 5, 40Â° C. 
     Family 61 glycoside hydrolase: The term â€œFamily 61 glycoside hydrolaseâ€ or â€œFamily GH61â€ or â€œGH61â€ means a polypeptide falling into the glycoside hydrolase Family 61 according to Henrissat B., 1991, A classification of glycosyl hydrolases based on amino-acid sequence similarities,  Biochem. J.  280: 309-316, and Henrissat and Bairoch, 1996, Updating the sequence-based classification of glycosyl hydrolases,  Biochem. J.  316: 695-696. The enzymes in this family were originally classified as a glycoside hydrolase family based on measurement of very weak endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase activity in one family member. The structure and mode of action of these enzymes are non-canonical and they cannot be considered as bona fide glycosidases. However, they are kept in the CAZy classification on the basis of their capacity to enhance the breakdown of cellulose when used in conjunction with a cellulase or a mixture of cellulases. 
     Hemicellulolytic enzyme or hemicellulase: The term â€œhemicellulolytic enzymeâ€ or â€œhemicellulaseâ€ means one or more (e.g., several) enzymes that hydrolyze a hemicellulosic material. See, for example, Shallom and Shoham, 2003, Microbial hemicellulases.  Current Opinion In Microbiology  6(3): 219-228). Hemicellulases are key components in the degradation of plant biomass.

The extract of text citing that article is:  release the beta and gamma phosphates and the detection marker, which is free to diffuse in the sample well, resulting in a decrease in emission detected from the fluorophore. 
     In some embodiments, the polymerase is a polymerase with high processivity. However, in some embodiments, the polymerase is a polymerase with reduced processivity. Polymerase processivity generally refers to the capability of a polymerase to consecutively incorporate dNTPs into a nucleic acid template without releasing the nucleic acid template. 
     In some embodiments, the polymerase is a polymerase with low 5â€²-3â€² exonuclease activity and/or 3â€²-5â€² exonuclease. In some embodiments, the polymerase is modified (e.g., by amino acid substitution) to have reduced 5â€²-3â€² exonuclease activity and/or 3â€²-5â€² activity relative to a corresponding wild-type polymerase. Further non-limiting examples of DNA polymerases include 9Â° Nmâ„¢ DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and a P680G mutant of the Klenow exo-polymerase (Tuske et al. (2000) JBC 275(31):23759-23768). In some embodiments, a polymerase having reduced processivity provides increased accuracy for sequencing templates containing one or more stretches of nucleotide repeats (e.g., two or more sequential bases of the same type). 
     Embodiments directed toward single molecule RNA extension (e.g., for RNA sequencing) may use any reverse transcriptase that is capable of synthesizing complementary DNA (cDNA) from an RNA template. In such embodiments, a reverse transcriptase can function in a manner similar to polymerase in that cDNA can be synthesized from an RNA template via the incorporation of dNTPs to a reverse transcription primer annealed to an RNA template. The cDNA can then participate in a sequencing reaction and its sequence determined as described above and elsewhere herein. The determined sequence of the cDNA can then be used, via sequence complementarity, to determine the sequence of the original RNA template. Examples of reverse transcriptases inclu",0.95

No. 7,186,399, Lanza et al. describe an in vivo or in vitro method for ligand-based binding of lipid encapsulated particles to molecular epitopes on a surface. This is accomplished by the sequential delivery of a site specific ligand activated with biotin activating agent, an avidin activating agent, and lipid encapsulated particles activated with a biotin activating agent. 
     The simultaneous delivery of targeted higher order aggregates of contrast agents has also been described in the literature. These higher order aggregates employ microbubbles, liposomes, nanoparticles, bubble liposomes, liposomal bubbles, nanostructured materials, supramolecular aggregates, quantum dotes, nanotubes, and micelles in various combinations. Many of these particles are multimodal and have therapeutic properties. See for example, Lentacker et al. (2010); Suzuki et al. (2007 and 2008); Myhr et al. (2006); Tinkov et al.

     Unfortunately, typical adhesion rates of microbubbles retained at the target site are low (on the order of 10 microbubbles per microliter of tissue (Dayton, 2009)), even with the addition of acoustic radiation force. In particular, Dayton (2009) listed the following limitations for targeted contrast agent technology: (1) the low number of contrast agents adherent to a target site; (2) lack of sensitivity to small numbers of contrast agents; and (3) the high background from circulating untargeted contrast. These limitations are discussed in greater detail herein below.

The patent in question is titled Cellulolytic enzyme compositions and uses thereof.  The extract of text citing that article is:  to hemicellulose. Cellulose is a homopolymer of anhydrocellobiose and thus a linear beta-(1-4)-D-glucan, while hemicelluloses include a variety of compounds, such as xylans, xyloglucans, arabinoxylans, and mannans in complex branched structures with a spectrum of substituents. Although generally polymorphous, cellulose is found in plant tissue primarily as an insoluble crystalline matrix of parallel glucan chains. Hemicelluloses usually hydrogen bond to cellulose, as well as to other hemicelluloses, which help stabilize the cell wall matrix. 
     Cellulose is generally found, for example, in the stems, leaves, hulls, husks, and cobs of plants or leaves, branches, and wood of trees. The cellulosic material can be, but is not limited to, agricultural residue, herbaceous material (including energy crops), municipal solid waste, pulp and paper mill residue, waste paper, and wood (including forestry residue) (see, for example, Wiselogel et al., 1995, in Handbook on Bioethanol (Charles E.

     A number of animal models of are useful for establishing a range of therapeutically effective doses of reversible or irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds for treating any of the foregoing diseases. 
     For example, dosing of reversible or irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds for treating an autoimmune disease can be assessed in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis. In this model, arthritis is induced in Balb/c mice by administering anti-collagen antibodies and lipopolysaccharide. See Nandakumar et al. (2003),  Am. J. Pathol  163:1827-1837. 
     In another example, dosing of reversible or irreversible Btk inhibitors for the treatment of B-cell proliferative disorders can be examined in, e.g., a human-to-mouse xenograft model in which human B-cell lymphoma cells (e.g. Ramos cells) are implanted into immunodefficient mice (e.g., â€œnudeâ€ mice) as described in, e.g., Pagel et al. (2005), Clin Cancer Res 11(13):4857-4866. 
     Animal models for treatment of thromboembolic disorders are also known. 
     The therapeutic efficacy of the compound for one of the foregoing diseases can be optimized during a course of treatment. For example, a subject being treated can undergo a diagnostic evaluation to correlate the relief of disease symptoms or pathologies to inhibition of in vivo Btk activity achieved by administering a given dose of an irreversible Btk inhibitor. Cellular assays known in the art can be used to determine in vivo activity of Btk in the presence or absence of an irreversible Btk inhibitor. For example, since activated Btk is phosphorylated at tyrosine 223 (Y223) and tyrosine 551 (Y551), phospho-specific immunocytochemical staining of P-Y223 or P-Y551-positive cells can be used to detect or quantify activation of Bkt in a population of cells (e.g., by FACS analysis of stained vs unstained cells).

     Computer implementations of these mathematical algorithms can be utilized for comparison of sequences to determine sequence identity. Such implementations include, but are not limited to: CLUSTAL in the PC/Gene program (available from Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif.); the ALIGN program (Version 2.0) and GAP, BESTFIT, BLAST, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Version 8 (available from Genetics Computer Group (GCG), 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis., USA). Alignments using these programs can be performed using the default parameters. The CLUSTAL program is well described by Higgins et al. (1988) Gene 73:237 244 (1988); Higgins et al.

     Also provided in the present disclosure are expression vectors and host cells for producing the anti-VP1 antibodies described above. Various expression vectors can be employed to express the polynucleotides encoding the anti-VP1 antibody chains or binding fragments. Both viral-based and nonviral expression vectors can be used to produce the antibodies in a mammalian host cell. Nonviral vectors and systems include plasmids, episomal vectors, typically with an expression cassette for expressing a protein or RNA, and human artificial chromosomes (see, e.g., Harrington et al., Nat Genet 15:345, 1997). For example, nonviral vectors useful for expression of the anti-VP1 polynucleotides and polypeptides in mammalian (e.g., human) cells include pThioHis A, B &amp; C, pcDNA3.1/His, pEBVHis A, B &amp; C (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.), MPSV vectors, and numerous other vectors known in the art for expressing other proteins.

     Discovery and Optimization of NGF Antibodies 
     Nerve growth factor (NGF) has been shown to be a critical survival and maintenance factor in the development of peripheral sympathetic and embryonic sensory neurons and of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (Smeyne, et al., Nature 368:246-249 (1994); Crowley, et al., Cell 76:1001-1011 (1994)). 
     NGF activity is mediated through two different membrane-bound receptors, the TrkA tyrosine kinase receptor and the p75 receptor, which are structurally related to other members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family (Chao, et al., Science 232:518-521 (1986)). NGF receptors have been found on a variety of cell types outside of the nervous system. For example, TrkA has been found on human monocytes, T- and B-lymphocytes and mast cells. 
     A direct relationship between increased NGF levels and a variety of inflammatory conditions has been established in human patients as well as in several animal models. These include systemic lupus erythematosus (Bracci-Laudiero, et al., Neuroreport 4:563-565 (1993)), multiple sclerosis (Bracci-Laudiero, et al., Neurosci. Lett. 147:9-12 (1992)), psoriasis (Raychaudhuri, et al., Acta Derm. l&#39;enereol. 78:84-86 (1998)), arthritis (Falcimi, et al., Ann. Rheum.

The extract of text citing that article is:  been shown to predominately express CXCL10, with lower levels of CXCL9, in mouse models of T1D (Christen et al The Journal of Immunology, 2003, 171: 6838-6845; Morimoto et al.  J Immunol  2004; 173; 7017-7024; Sarkar et al. Diabetes. 2012 February; 61(2):436-46); and in islets from T1D patients having insulitis (Uno et al 2010; Roep et al Clinical and Experimental Immunology, 2003, 159: 338-343; Sarkar et al.  Diabetes.  2012 February; 61(2):436-46). In addition, T cells that have infiltrated the pancreas have been shown to express CXCR3 in T1D mice models and type 1 diabetes patient pancreas samples (Christen et al,  The Journal of Immunology,  2003, 171: 6838-6845; Van Halteren et al.,  Diabetologia  48:75-82 (2005); Uno et al 2010; Roep et al.,  Clinical and Experimental Immunology,  2003, 159: 338-343; Sarkar et al.,  Diabetes.  2012 February; 61(2):436-46). Furthermore, knockout mice deficient in CXCR3 demonstrate a significant delay in onset and a reduction in incidence of T1D (Frigerio et al.,  Nature Medicine  8:1414-1420 (2002)), while overexpression of CXCL10 in the islets of transgenic mice promotes T cell infiltration and accelerates the onset of T1D (Rhode et al.,  J. Immunol.  175(6): 3516-24 (2005)). Neutralization of CXCL10 by antibody treatment has been shown to be protective (Christen et al.,  The Journal of Immunology,  2003, 171: 6838-6845). 
     There are three isoforms of CXCR3, denoted A, B, and Alt., that have been identified in humans (Lasagni et al.  J. Exp. Med.  2003 197:1537; Ehlert et al  J. Immunol.  2004; 173; 6234-6240), CXCR3-A binds to the CXC chemokines CXCL9 (MIG), CXCL10 (IP-10), and CXCL11 (I-TAC); CXCR3-B also binds to these targets but also binds CXCL4; CXCR3-Alt appears to interact with CXCL11. Although alternative splicing leads to the generation of several protein isoforms of CXCR3, CXCR3-A is the predominant form in vivo as the CXCR3-B and CXCR3-Alt are expressed at much lower levels at the protein levels.

The patent in question is titled Methods systems and devices for the delivery of endoluminal prostheses.  The extract of text citing that article is: nable under light microscopic examination. Such non-collagenous solids can constitute a significant percentage of the dry weight of the ECM material in certain inventive embodiments, for example at least about 1%, at least about 3%, and at least about 5% by weight in various embodiments of the invention. 
     The submucosa or other ECM material used in illustrative embodiments may also exhibit an angiogenic character and thus be effective to induce angiogenesis in a host engrafted with the material. In this regard, angiogenesis is the process through which the body makes new blood vessels to generate increased blood supply to tissues. Thus, angiogenic materials, when contacted with host tissues, promote or encourage the formation of new blood vessels. Methods for measuring in vivo angiogenesis in response to biomaterial implantation have recently been developed. For example, one such method uses a subcutaneous implant model to determine the angiogenic character of a material. See, C. Heeschen et al., Nature Medicine 7 (2001), No. 7, 833-839. When combined with a fluorescence microangiography technique, this model can provide both quantitative and qualitative measures of angiogenesis into biomaterials. C. Johnson et al., Circulation Research 94 (2004), No. 2, 262-268.

     A review describing immune checkpoint pathways and the blockade of such pathways with immune checkpoint inhibitor compounds is provided by Pardoll in  Nature Reviews Cancer  (April, 2012), pages 252-264. Immune check point inhibitor compounds display anti-tumor activity by blocking one or more of the endogenous immune checkpoint pathways that downregulate an anti-tumor immune response. The inhibition or blockade of an immune checkpoint pathway typically involves inhibiting a checkpoint receptor and ligand interaction with an immune checkpoint inhibitor compound to reduce or eliminate the down regulation signal and resulting diminishment of the anti-tumor response. 
     In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the immune checkpoint inhibitor compound inhibits the signaling interaction between an immune checkpoint receptor and the corresponding ligand of the immune checkpoint receptor. The immune checkpoint inhibitor compound can act by blocking activation of the immune checkpoint pathway by inhibition (anatagonism) of an immune checkpoint receptor (some examples of receptors include CTLA-4, PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3, BTLA, and KIR) or by inhibition of a ligand of an im",0.62

The patent in question is titled Production of recombinant proteins utilizing non-antibiotic selection methods and the incorporation of non-natural amino acids therein.  The extract of text citing that article is: l pairs for use in cells are included in the invention. The development of multiple orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pairs can allow the simultaneous incorporation of multiple non-natural amino acids using different codons in a cell. 
     An orthogonal O-tRNA/O-RS pair in a cell can be produced by importing a pair, e.g., a nonsense suppressor pair, from a different organism with inefficient cross species aminoacylation. The O-tRNA and O-RS are efficiently expressed and processed in the cell and the O-tRNA is efficiently exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. For example, one such pair is the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA.sub.CUA pair from  E. coli  (see, e.g., H. M. Goodman, et al., (1968), Nature 217:1019-24; and, D. G. Barker, et al., (1982), FEBS Letters 150:419-23).  E. coli  tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase efficiently aminoacylates its cognate  E. coli  tRNA.CUA when both are expressed in the cytoplasm of  S. cerevisiae , but does not aminoacylate  S. cerevisiae  tRNA&#39;s. See, e.g., H. Edwards, &amp; P. Schimmel, (1990), Molecular &amp; Cellular Biology 10:1633-41; and, H. Edwards, et al., (1991), PNAS United States of America 88:1153-6. In addition,  E. coli  tyrosyl tRNA.sub.CUA is a poor substrate for  S. cerevisiae  aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (see, e.g., V. Trezeguet, et al., (1991), Molecular &amp; Cellular Biology 11:2744-51), but functions efficiently in protein translation in  S. cerevisiae . See, e.g., H. Edwards, &amp; P.

     Background of the Invention 
     Boronic acid and ester compounds display a variety of pharmaceutically useful biological activities. Shenvi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,499,082 (1985), discloses that peptide boronic acids are inhibitors of certain proteolytic enzymes. Kettner and Shenvi, U.S. Pat. No. 5,187,157 (1993), U.S. Pat. No. 5,242,904 (1993), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,250,720 (1993), describe a class of peptide boronic acids that inhibit trypsin-like proteases. Kleeman et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,169,841 (1992), discloses N-terminally modified peptide boronic acids that inhibit the action of renin. Kinder et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,106,948 (1992), discloses that certain tripeptide boronic acid compounds inhibit the growth of cancer cells. 
     More recently, boronic acid and ester compounds have displayed particular promise as inhibitors of the proteasome, a multicatalytic protease responsible for the majority of intracellular protein turnover. Ciechanover,  Cell,  79: 13-21 (1994), discloses that the proteasome is the proteolytic component of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in which proteins are targeted for degradation by conjugation to multiple molecules of ubiquitin. Ciechanover also discloses that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a key role in a variety of important physiological processes.

The patent in question is titled Topical pterostilbene compositions for use in treating UV-induced loss of barrier function in skin.  The extract of text citing that article is: ecular mechanisms of ultraviolet radiation-induced DNA damage and repair,â€  J. Nucleic Acids  (2010) 2010: 592980). These abundant DNA lesions, if unrepaired, can interfere with DNA replication and subsequently cause mutations in DNA. Thus, these lesions can be mutagenic (potentially leading to proliferative disorders) and/or can be cytotoxic (resulting in cell death). 64 pp occur at about one third the frequency of CPDs, but are more mutagenic (Sinha &amp; Hader, 2002). In one embodiment, prevention of these UV-mediated DNA adducts is paramount to guarding against the onset of several proliferative disorders, ranging from aging to cancer. 
     UV-mediated Hyperplasia 
     Increased keratinocyte proliferation, resulting in hyperplasia, is another major detrimental effect caused by UV exposure. This thickening of the skin is a direct result of the body trying to protect itself after excessive exposure to UV light. However, epidermal hyperplasia also increases the risk of skin cancer (Bowden, G. T., â€œPrevention of non-melanoma skin cancer by targeting ultraviolet-B-light signaling,â€  Nat. Rev. Cancer  (2004) 4: 23-35). In another embodiment, prevention of UV-mediated hyperplasia is paramount to guarding against the onset of several proliferative disorders, ranging from aging to cancer. 
     UV-mediated Loss of Barrier Function 
     Maintaining a water-impermeable barrier between the organism and the environment is an essential function of skin. This barrier function serves to prevent dehydration; which can lead to death of the organism (Jiang, S. J., et al., â€œUltraviolet B-induced alterations of the skin barrier and epidermal calcium gradient,â€  Exp. Dermatol . (2007) 16: 985-992). UV light has been demonstrated to disrupt epidermal skin barrier function in a dose-dependent manner (Haratake, A., et al., â€œUVB-induced alterations in permeability barrier function: roles for epidermal hyperproliferation and thymocyte-mediated responseâ€  J. Invest. Dermatol . (1997) 108: 769-775; and prey. citation). Skin barrier dysfunction can be directly assessed by measuring Transepidermal Water Loss (T",0.06

The patent in question is titled Maize event DP-004114-3 and methods for detection thereof.  The extract of text citing that article is: y the maize polyubiquitin promoter (Christensen et al. (1992)  Plant Mol. Biol.  118(4):675-89), providing constitutive expression of the Cry1F protein in maize. This region also includes the 5â€² untranslated region (UTR) and intron associated with the native polyubiquitin promoter. The terminator for the cry1F gene is the poly(A) addition signal from Open Reading Frame 25 (ORF 25) of the  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  Ti plasmid pTi15955 (Barker et al. (1983)  Plant Mol. Biol.  2:335-350). 
     The second cassette contains the cry34Ab1 gene isolated from  Bacillus thuringiensis  strain PS149B1 (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,127,180; 6,624,145 and 6,340,593). The Cry34Ab1 protein (SEQ ID NO: 2) is 123 amino acid residues in length and has a molecular weight of approximately 14 kDa. The expression of the cry34Ab1 gene is controlled by a second copy of the maize polyubiquitin promoter with 5â€² UTR and intron (Christensen et al., 1992, supra). The terminator for the cry34Ab1 gene is the pinII terminator (Keil et al. (1986)  Nucleic Acids Res.  14:5641-5650; An et al. (1989)  Plant Cell  1:115-22). 
     The third gene cassette contains the cry35Ab1 gene, also isolated from  Bacillus thuringiensis  strain PS149B1 (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,083,499; 6,548,291 and 6,340,593). The Cry35Ab1 protein (SEQ ID NO: 3) has a length of 383 amino acids and a molecular weight of approximately 44 kDa. Simultaneous expression of the Cry34Ab1 and Cry35Ab1 proteins in the plant confers resistance to coleopteran insects. The expression of the cry35Ab1 gene is controlled by the  Triticum aestivum  (wheat) peroxidase promoter and leader sequence (Hertig et al. (1991)  Plant Mol. Biol.  16:171-174).

     Calicheamicin 
     Another immunoconjugate of interest comprises an anti-TAT antibody conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double-stranded DNA breaks at sub-picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,712,374, 5,714,586, 5,739,116, 5,767,285, 5,770,701, 5,770,710, 5,773,001, 5,877,296 (all to American Cyanamid Company). Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include, but are not limited to, Î³1I, Î±2I, Î±3I, N-acetyl-Î³1I, PSAG and Î¸I1 (Hinman et al., Cancer Research 53:3336-3342 (1993), Lode et al., Cancer Research 58:2925-2928 (1998) and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid). Another anti-tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore, cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects. 
     Other Cytotoxic Agents 
     Other antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the anti-TAT antibodies of the invention include BCNU, streptozoicin, vincristine and 5-fluorouracil, the family of agents known collectively LL-E33288 complex described in U.S. Pat.

No. 5,364,780) and alcohol-inducible (Int&#39;l Patent Application Publication Nos. WO 97/06269 and WO 97/06268) systems and glutathione S-transferase promoters. Chemical-inducible promoters therefore can be used to modulate the expression of a nucleotide sequence of interest in a plant by applying an exogenous chemical regulator. Depending upon the objective, the promoter can be a chemical-inducible promoter, whereby application of the chemical induces gene expression, or a chemical-repressible promoter, whereby application of the chemical represses gene expression. See also, Gatz (1997)  Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol.  48:89. 
     Other inducible promoters include promoters from genes inducibly regulated in response to environmental stress or stimuli such as drought, pathogens, salinity and wounds. See, Graham et al.

     The TAS method is a method for specifically amplifying a target RNA in which a transcript is obtained from a template RNA by a cDNA synthesis step and an RNA transcription step. In the cDNA synthesis step, a sequence recognized by a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (i.e., a polymerase-binding sequence or PBS) is inserted into the cDNA copy downstream of the target or marker sequence to be amplified using a two-domain oligonucleotide primer. In the second step, an RNA polymerase is used to synthesize multiple copies of RNA from the cDNA template. Amplification using TAS requires only a few cycles because DNA-dependent RNA transcription can result in 10-1000 copies for each copy of cDNA template. TAS can be performed according to Kwoh et al., PNAS 86:1173 (1989). The TAS method has been described, for example, in International Patent Application Publication No. WO1988/010315, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
     Transcription mediated amplification (TMA) is a transcription-based isothermal amplification reaction that uses RNA transcription by RNA polymerase and DNA transcription by reverse transcriptase to produce an RNA amplicon from target nucleic acid. TMA methods are advantageous in that they can produce 100 to 1000 copies of amplicon per amplification cycle, as opposed to PCR or LCR methods that produce only 2 copies per cycle.

Exemplary coupling molecule pairs include, without limitations, any haptenic or antigenic compound in combination with a corresponding antibody or binding portion or fragment thereof (e.g., digoxigenin and anti-digoxigenin; mouse immunoglobulin and goat antimouse immunoglobulin) and nonimmunological binding pairs (e.g., biotin-avidin, biotin-streptavidin), hormone (e.g., thyroxine and cortisol-hormone binding protein), receptor-receptor agonist, receptor-receptor antagonist (e.g., acetylcholine receptor-acetylcholine or an analog thereof), IgG-protein A, lectin-carbohydrate, enzyme-enzyme cofactor, enzyme-enzyme inhibitor, and complementary oligonucleotide pairs capable of forming nucleic acid duplexes). The coupling molecule pair can also include a first molecule that is negatively charged and a second molecule that is positively charged. 
     One non-limiting example of using conjugation with a coupling molecule pair is the biotin-sandwich method. See, e.g., Davis et al., 103 PNAS 8155 (2006). The two molecules to be conjugated together are biotinylated and then conjugated together using tetravalent streptavidin. In addition, a peptide can be coupled to the 15-amino acid sequence of an acceptor peptide for biotinylation (referred to as AP; Chen et al., 2 Nat. Methods 99 (2005)). The acceptor peptide sequence allows site-specific biotinylation by the  E. Coli  enzyme biotin ligase (BirA; Id.). An engineered microbe surface-binding domain can be similarly biotinylated for conjugation with a solid substrate. Many commercial kits are also available for biotinylating proteins. Another example for conjugation to a solid surface would be to use PLPâ€”mediated bioconjugation. See, e.g., Witus et al., 132 JACS 16812 (2010).

     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     I. Field of the Invention 
     The present invention relates generally to the fields of cancer biology and medicine. More particularly, it concerns methods for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of carcinomas and risk factors thereof. 
     II. Description of Related Art 
     A major impediment to the translation of cancer chemoprevention research into clinical practice has been marginal agent efficacy and toxicities that exceed benefit (Psaty and Potter, 2006; Lippman, 2006). For example, the demonstrated marked efficacy of polyamine-inhibitory combination of long-term daily oral D,L-Î±-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO, eflornithine) and sulindac among colorectal adenoma (CRA) patients was recently demonstrated (Meyskens et al., 2008), however, treatment was associated with modest, subclinical ototoxicity (McLaren et al., 2008), and a greater number of cardiovascular events among patients with high baseline cardiovascular risk (Zell et al., 2009). Identifying genetic features that identify the suitability of a patient for a given preventative or curative treatment regime would be a major benefit. 
     For example, there remains a need for effective and less toxic methods for treating and preventing colorectal cancers and other carcinomas. According to the National Cancer Institute, there were approximately 147,000 new cases and 50,000 deaths from colorectal cancer in the United States in 2009. Current treatment protocols, especially those for colon cancers ",0.0

The patent in question is titled Cannabinoid receptor mediating compounds.  The extract of text citing that article is: intake was reduced by Ëœ20% during the first week and body weight was progressively reduced by Ëœ10% relative to vehicle-treated DIO mice, but remained significantly higher than the weight of lean mice on regular diet. Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were determined on the last 2 days of treatment, using i.p. glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity tests. DIO mice show glucose intolerance (blood glucose following an i.p. glucose load of 1.5 g/kg rises higher and takes longer to return to baseline than in lean mice) and insulin resistance (reduction of blood glucose by insulin is attenuated). In compound 2-treated DIO mice, both of these parameters were nearly completely normalized. 
     The Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat is a commonly used animal model of type 2 diabetes with progressive Î²-cell loss resulting in extreme hyperglycemia. Recently, we showed that peripheral CB 1 R antagonism prevents Î²-cell loss by blocking CB 1 R in infiltrating, proinflammatory macrophages. (Jourdan et al, Nature Med 2013, 19-(9):1132-1140). This highlights the therapeutic potential of peripheral CB 1 R antagonists in type 2 diabetes. The compound 2 prevented the increase in blood glucose, and the parallel decline in insulin and c-peptide levels in ZDF rats ( FIG. 6 ) which indicates prevention of Î²-cell loss as reported recently (Jourdan et al, Nature Med 2013, 19-(9):1132-1140). 
     Fibrosis results from excessive extracellular matrix deposition by myofibroblasts accompanying chronic inflammation and wound healing, and is a key pathogenic process in many organs, including kidneys, lung, and liver. Since the prototype CB 1 R antagonist rimonabant was reported to have an anti-fibrotic effect in mouse models of liver fibrosis (Teixeira-Clerc, Nature Med 2006 12(6); 671-676) we also used CCl 4 -induced liver fibrosis model in mice to assess the in vivo efficacy of compound 2. In order to compare its efficacy with that of rimonabant, we treated mice either with rimonabant or compound 2E1 ( FIG. 7 ). Com",0.98

     Shotgun mutagenesis mapping utilizes a comprehensive plasmid-mutation library for the target gene, with each clone in the library bearing a unique amino acid mutation and the entire library covering every amino acid in the target protein. The clones that constitute the mutation library are individually arranged in microplates, expressed within living mammalian cells, and tested for immunoreactivity with antibodies of interest. Amino acids critical for antibody epitopes are identified by a loss of reactivity and are then mapped onto a protein structure to visualize epitopes. By automating the analysis, new epitope maps can be derived within days to weeks. Because it uses the native structure of proteins within mammalian cells, the technique allows both linear and conformational epitope structures to be mapped on complex proteins. (See, e.g., Paes et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.  131(20): 6952-6954 (2009); Banik and Doranz,  Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News  3(2): 25-28 (2010)). 
     The epitope bound by an anti-beta klotho antibody may also be determined using peptide scanning methods. In peptide scanning, libraries of short peptide sequences from overlapping segments of the target protein, beta klotho, are tested for their ability to bind antibodies of interest. The peptides are synthesized and screened for binding, e.g., using ELISA or BIACORE, or on a chip, by any of the multiple methods for solid-phase screening (see, e.g., Reineke et al.,  Curr. Opin. Biotechnol.  12: 59-64, 2001) as in the â€œpepscanâ€ methodology (see, e.g., WO 84/03564; WO 93/09872). Such peptide screening methods may not be capable of detecting some discontinuous functional epitopes, i.e. functional epitopes that involve amino acid residues that are not contiguous along the primary sequence of the beta klotho polypeptide chain.

     Antibody Immune-affinity Purification of mIgM 
     Antibody purification of mIgM was accomplished using mAb1-1 or mAb1-1 with mAb2-2b and mAb3-2b covalently bound immune-affinity beads (Pierce Inc., Rockford, Ill., USA), application of CRL-1648 NP-40 extract and then washing beads at pH 8.6 in Tris solution. Further washing was done in PBS at pH 7.0 and then eluting mIgM at pH 4.0. Sterile filtered mIgM batches were stored at 4Â° C. at 500 micrograms/ml in sterile PBS with/without azide. 
     EXAMPLE 4 
     Specificity Analysis 
     Hemadsorption tests of the panel of antibodies against an epithelial cell-line bank was done to eliminate clones with non-specific cross reactivity (Rettig W J, et al., Int J Cancer 58:385-392 (1994); Kitamura K, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91:12957-12961 (1994); Garin-Chesa P, et al., Int J Oncol 9:465-471 (1996); Rader C, et al., J Biol Chem 275; 13668-13676 (2000)). A subset of these epithelial cell lines had been tested by RT-PCR for PD sequence to define true negatives, however, mIgM has never been reported to be expressed by malignant cells other than those of B-cell lineage and the studies herein did not reveal these sequences in any of the cell lines in the panel. This observation was extended by RT-PCR of a panel of melanomas and sarcomas for the PD 13-mer mIgM and 18-mer mIgG and found no signal demonstrating expression of this peptide in these non-B-cell lineage cells. Thus, any binding would represent cross reactivity and not BCRC antigen detection. The binding of antibodies to cell surfaces of tumor cells was detected microscopically by adsorption of erythrocytes coated with anti-mouse Ig antibody or protein A. The titer was defined as the highest dilution of reagent giving maximum rosetting (Rettig W J, et al., Int J Cancer 58:385-392 (1994); Kitamura K, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91:12957-12961 (1994); Garin-Chesa P, et al., In",0.78

The latter is referred to as â€˜haplotype tag SNPs (htSNPs)â€™, markers that capture the haplotypes of a gene or a region of linkage disequilibrium. See Johnson et al. (2001) and Ke and Cardon (2003), each of which is incorporated herein by reference, for exemplary methods. 
     The VDA-assay utilizes PCR amplification of genomic segments by long PCR methods using TaKaRa LA Taq reagents and other standard reaction conditions. The long amplification can amplify DNA sizes of about 2,000-12,000 bp. Hybridization of products to variant detector array (VDA) can be performed by a Affymetrix High Throughput Screening Center and analyzed with computerized software. 
     A method called Chip Assay uses PCR amplification of genomic segments by standard or long PCR protocols. Hybridization products are analyzed by VDA, Halushka et al. (1999), incorporated herein by reference. SNPs are generally classified as â€œCertainâ€ or â€œLikelyâ€ based on computer analysis of hybridization patterns. By comparison to alternative detection methods such as nucleotide sequencing, â€œCertainâ€ SNPs have been confirmed 100% of the time; and â€œLikelyâ€ SNPs have been confirmed 73% of the time by this method. 
     Other methods simply involve PCR amplification following digestion with the relevant restriction enzyme. Yet others involve sequencing of purified PCR products from known genomic regions. 
     In yet another method, individual exons or overlapping fragments of large exons are PCR-amplified. Primers are designed from published or database sequences and PCR-amplification of genomic DNA is performed using the following conditions: 200 ng DNA template, 0.5 Î¼M each primer, 80 Î¼M each of dCTP, dATP, dTTP and dGTP, 5% formamide, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 U of Taq polymerase and 0.1 volume of the Taq buffer.

The patent in question is titled Quaternary ammonium hydroxides.  The extract of text citing that article is:  in Example 1 is repeated, with the following two modifications: (1) glycidol is used instead of the glycidyl ether, and (2) the glycidol, being much more viscous than the glycidyl ether, is diluted with methanol rather than used neat in order to facilitate addition by syringe. Targeted hydroxide concentration is 1.00 mol/kg, and the concentration actually found by titration is 1.00 mol/kg.
 
     The quaternary ammonium hydroxide of this Example is not a new composition of matter. Its preparation, by a method similar to that described here, has been reported by Beckett, et. al. (Polyhedron, vol. 27, pp 2226-2230, 2008). As a further check on the present method, the hydroxide is neutralized with 48% aqueous HBr, volatiles removed and the crude quaternary ammonium bromide recrystallized from IPA. The purified quaternary ammonium bromide has physical and spectral properties identical with literature values for material prepared by alkylation of trimethylamine by 3-bromo-1,2-propanediol (Jaeger, et. al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 111, pp. 3001-3006, 1989). 
     EXAMPLE 4 
     A portion of the methanol solution obtained in Example 3 (approximately 7.4 g, containing 7.4Ã—10 âˆ’3  moles of the quaternary ammonium hydroxide) in a 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube is evaporated under a stream of dry nitrogen to a viscous oil. The tube containing this viscous oil is placed in a vacuum chamber and held for 2 hours at &lt;10 âˆ’2  mm Hg, during which time the last traces of solvent are removed. The initially mobile, viscous oil becomes immobile, but does not solidify. 
     Pure DMSO (13.34 g) is added to the tube immediately upon its removal from the vacuum chamber, the cap is tightly secured and the contents of the tube gently agitated. After less than 5 minutes all solids dissolve to yield a clear, colorless solution. Analysis of this solution by titration reveals an OH âˆ’  concentration of 0.50 mol/kg (target 0.50 mol/kg).

Purified POH is effective in killing both U251 human glioma cells (temozolomide-sensitive) and U251 temozolomide-resistant cells. The efficacy of purified POH on U251 temozolomide-resistant cells is also demonstrated by the colony formation assays shown in  FIG. 3C . 
     POH has also been demonstrated to inhibit glioma invasion through a Boyden matrigel chamber, suggesting that it also has anti-invasion properties. 
     POH was found to be anti-angiogenic, as POH inhibited production of the pro-angiogenic cytokines vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin 8 (IL8) by glioma cells. Functional assays for inhibition of VEGF secretion and IL-8 secretion by POH have been performed via ELISA assays ( FIG. 9 ). POH has been shown to inhibit G1 cell cycle arrest. Pyrko et al.

In addition, it may overcome the immunosuppressive functions of transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGFÎ²-2) secreted by glioma cells. 
     U251 glioma cells were treated with Sigma POH or purified POH for 24 hours, then Western blot was performed. The results ( FIG. 12 ) demonstrate that POH treatment decreased K-Ras and H-Ras expression.

     As used herein, the term â€œbiomassâ€ has its conventional meaning in the art and refers to any organic source of energy or chemicals that is renewable. Its major components can be: (1) trees (wood) and all other vegetation; (2) agricultural products and wastes (corn, fruit, garbage ensilage, etc.); (3) algae and other marine plants; (4) metabolic wastes (manure, sewage), and (5) cellulosic urban waste. Examples of biomass materials are described, for example, in Huber, G. W. et al, â€œSynthesis of Transportation Fuels from Biomass: Chemistry, Catalysts, and Engineering,â€ Chem. Rev. 106, (2006), pp. 4044-4098. 
     Biomass is conventionally defined as the living or recently dead biological material that can be converted for use as fuel or for industrial production. The criterion as biomass is that the material should be recently participating in the carbon cycle so that the release of carbon in the combustion process results in no net increase averaged over a reasonably short period of time (for this reason, fossil fuels such as peat, lignite and coal are not considered biomass by this definition as they contain carbon that has not participated in the carbon cycle for a long time so that their combustion results in a net increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide). Most commonly, biomass refers to plant matter grown for use as biofuel, but it also includes plant or animal matter used for production of fibers, chemicals or heat.

Such techniques are generally known in the art and are disclosed, for example, in Sambrook et al. (1989)  Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual  (2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, N.Y.). 
     The methods of the invention involve the use of genomic DNA isolated from a plant. The methods of the invention do not depend on genomic DNA isolated by any particular method. Any method known in the art for isolating, or purifying, from a plant, genomic DNA, which can be used a source of template DNA for the PCR amplifications described above, can be employed in the methods of the invention.

There is clearly a need in the art for PEG derivatives that are chemically inert in physiological environments until called upon to react selectively to form stable chemical bonds. 
     Recently, an entirely new technology in the protein sciences has been reported, which promises to overcome many of the limitations associated with site-specific modifications of proteins. Specifically, new components have been added to the protein biosynthetic machinery of the prokaryote  Escherichia coli  ( E. coli ) (e.g., L. Wang, et al., (2001),  Science  292:498-500) and the eukaryote  Sacchronyces cerevisiae  ( S. cerevisiae ) (e.g., J.

     Essential Genes and Auxotrophs 
     As used herein, the term â€œessential geneâ€ refers to a gene that is necessary for cell growth and/or survival. Bacterial essential genes are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art, and can be identified by directed deletion of genes and/or random mutagenesis and screening (see, e.g., Zhang and Lin, â€œDEG 5.0, a database of essential genes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes,â€ Nucl Acids Res, 2009; 37:D455-D458 and Gerdes et al., â€œEssential genes on metabolic maps,â€ Curr Opin Biotechnol, 2006; 17(5):448-456, the entire contents of each of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference). 
     An â€œessential geneâ€ may be dependent on the circumstances and environment in which an organism lives. For example, a mutation of, modification of, or excision of an essential gene may result in the genetically engineered bacteria of the disclosure becoming an auxotroph.

     â€œLigationâ€ means to form a covalent bond or linkage between the termini of two or more nucleic acids, e.g. oligonucleotides and/or polynucleotides, in a template-driven reaction. The nature of the bond or linkage may vary widely and the ligation may be carried out enzymatically or chemically. As used herein, ligations are usually carried out enzymatically to form a phosphodiester linkage between a 5â€² carbon of a terminal nucleotide of one oligonucleotide with 3â€² carbon of another oligonucleotide. A variety of template-driven ligation reactions are described in the following references, which are incorporated by reference: Whitely et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,883,750; Letsinger et al. U.S. Pat.

The patent in question is titled Thioflavin derivatives for use in antemortem diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and in vivo imaging and prevention of amyloid deposition.  The extract of text citing that article is: cted population reaching as high as 40-50% by ages 85-90. Evans et al.  JAMA  262: 2551 (1989); Katzman,  Neurology  43: 13 (1993). 
     In practice, AD is definitively diagnosed through examination of brain tissue, usually at autopsy. Khachaturian,  Arch. Neurol.  42: 1097 (1985); McKhann et al.,  Neurology  34: 939 (1984). Neuropathologically, this disease is characterized by the presence of neuritic plaques (NP), neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), and neuronal loss, along with a variety of other findings. Mann,  Mech. Ageing Dev.  31: 213 (1985). Post-mortem slices of brain tissue of victims of Alzheimer&#39;s disease exhibit the presence of amyloid in the form of proteinaceous extracellular cores of the neuritic plaques that are characteristic of AD. 
     The amyloid cores of these neuritic plaques are composed of a protein called the Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) that is arranged in a predominately beta-pleated sheet configuration. Mori et al.,  Journal of Biological Chemistry  267: 17082 (1992); Kirschner et al.,  PNAS  83: 503 (1986). Neuritic plaques are an early and invariant aspect of the disease. Mann et al.,  J. Neurol.

     The initial deposition of AÎ² probably occurs long before clinical symptoms are noticeable. The currently recommended â€œminimum microscopic criteriaâ€ for the diagnosis of AD is based on the number of neuritic plaques found in brain. Khachaturian,  Arch. Neurol ., supra (1985). Unfortunately, assessment of neuritic plaque counts must be delayed until after death.

QSYÂ®7 (xanthylium, 9-[2-[[4-[[(2,5-dioxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)oxy]carbonyl]-1-piperidinyl]sulfonyl]phenyl]-3,6-bis(methylphenylamino)-NHS ester, chloride, CAS Reg. No. 304014-12-8, Life Technologies) was added to the C-terminus of both linkers to act as an antibiotic surrogate ( FIG. 30 ). Incorporating QSYÂ®7 allowed for the cleavability of these linkers to be evaluated without consuming costly and labor-intensive antibiotics. 
     The experimental mal-peptide-QSY7 linkers were conjugated to THIOFAB S4497 to evaluate the cleavability of these linkers. Conjugations were performed as previously described. The resultant THIOFAB S4497 linker-QSY7 conjugates were assessed for cleavability by staphopain B, staphopain A, and human cathepsin B at pH 7.2 (Table 5). Like staphopain B, staphopain A is a secreted cysteine protease of  S. aureus  from the papain family of proteases. It is structurally similar to staphopain B, but has a broader substrate specificity (Filipek, R., M. Rzychon, et al. (2003). The Journal of biological chemistry 278 (42): 40959-40966). Cathepsin B, a mammalian cysteine lysosomal protease, is also a member of the papain family of endopeptidases. It is thought to cleave the valine-citruline linkers used in other AAC linkers described in this patent.

     Additionally, GPD polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences disclosed herein or known in the art can be used to identify other candidate GPD homologs in nature. For example, the GPD encoding nucleic acid sequences disclosed herein or known in the art can be used to isolate genes encoding homologous proteins. Isolation of homologous genes using sequence-dependent protocols include, but are not limited to (1) methods of nucleic acid hybridization; (2) methods of DNA and RNA amplification, as exemplified by various uses of nucleic acid amplification technologies (e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Mullis et al., U.S. Pat.

Increasing the K M  for NADH by altering GPD can decrease the rate of NADH oxidation catalyzed by GPD, thus allowing an increase in the availability of NADH in a host cell. The available NADH can be used by other enzymes in the product alcohol production pathway, for example, in the isobutanol production pathway the available NADH can be utilized by KARI and alcohol dehydrogenase. Thus, decreasing the affinity of GPD for NADH can increase product alcohol (e.g., isobutanol) production.

     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     The human epidermal growth factor receptor (also known as HER-1 or Erb-B1, and referred to herein as â€œEGFRâ€) is a 170 kDa transmembrane receptor encoded by the c-erbB protooncogene, and exhibits intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (Modjtahedi et al., Br. J. Cancer 73:228-235 (1996); Herbst and Shin, Cancer 94:1593-1611 (2002)). SwissProt database entry P00533 provides the sequence of human EGFR. EGFR regulates numerous cellular processes via tyrosine-kinase mediated signal transduction pathways, including, but not limited to, activation of signal transduction pathways that control cell proliferation, differentiation, cell survival, apoptosis, angiogenesis, mitogenesis, and metastasis (Atalay et al., Ann. Oncology 14:1346-1363 (2003); Tsao and Herbst, Signal 4:4-9 (2003); Herbst and Shin, Cancer 94:1593-1611 (2002); Modjtahedi et al., Br. J. Cancer 73:228-235 (1996)). 
     Known ligands of EGFR include EGF, TGFA/TGF-alpha, amphiregulin, epigen/EPGN, BTC/betacellulin, epiregulin/EREG and HBEGF/heparin-binding EGF. Ligand binding by EGFR triggers receptor homo- and/or heterodimerization and autophosphorylation of key cytoplasmic residues. The phosphorylated EGFR recruits adapter proteins like GRB2 which in turn activate complex downstream signaling cascades, including at least the following major downstream",0.0

The patent in question is titled Treatment of mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease.  The extract of text citing that article is: 94:5296-5301 (1997)). 
     Binding of ligands such as AGEs, S100/calgranulin/EN-RAGE, Î²-amyloid, CML (Ne-Carboxymethyl lysine), HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1) and amphoterin to RAGE has been shown to modify expression of a variety of genes. For example, in many cell types interaction between RAGE and its ligands generates oxidative stress, which thereby results in activation of the free radical sensitive transcription factor NF-ÎºB, and the activation of NF-ÎºB regulated genes, such as the cytokines IL-I Î², TNF-a, and the like. 
     As noted above, RAGE antagonists are useful in the treatment of the complications of diabetes. It has been shown that nonenzymatic glycoxidation of macromolecules ultimately resulting in the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) is enhanced at sites of inflammation, in renal failure, in the presence of hyperglycemia and other conditions associated with systemic or local oxidant stress (Dyer, D, et al., J. Clin. Invest., 91:2463-2469 (1993); Reddy, S., et al., Biochem., 34:10872-10878 (1995); Dyer, D., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 266: 11654-1 1660 (1991); Degenhardt, T., et al., Cell Mol. Biol, 44: 1139-1 145 (1998)). Accumulation of AGEs in the vasculature can occur focally, as in the joint amyloid composed of AGE-B2-microglobulin found in patients with dialysis-related amyloidosis (Miyata, T, et al, J. Clin. Invest, 92: 1243-1252 (1993); Miyata, T, et al, J. Clin. Invest, 98:1088-1094 (1996)), or generally, as exemplified by the vasculature and tissues of patients with diabetes (Schmidt, A-M, et al. Nature Med, 1:1002-1004 (1995)). The progressive accumulation of AGEs over time in patients with diabetes suggests that endogenous clearance mechanisms are not able to function effectively at sites of AGE deposition. Such accumulated AGEs have the capacity to alter cellular properties by a number of mechanisms. Although RAGE is expressed at low levels in normal tissues and vasculature, in an environment where the receptor&#39;s ligands accumulate, it has been shown that RAGE be",0.84

The extract of text citing that article is: used where the efficacy of the 2 top-ranked SMOs is performed, and these data used to make the next SMO choices in a strategic manner. For example if a SMO shows a significant but incomplete reduction in flip isoform expression, bases are added or subtracted from either end to further improve efficacy. 
     Experimental Example 7 
     Determine Changes in Electrophysiological Properties of AMPA Currents after Treatment with Lead SMOs 
     The SMOs that produce the most efficacious skipping of flip exons are transfected into NSC-34 cells and AMPA-receptor mediated currents are studied using whole cell patch clamp. Changes in flip/flop ratios of GluRs change properties of AMPA receptor-mediated currents. Increases in the flop to flip ratio result in the following changes in AMPA receptor currents: (i) An increase in desensitization kinetics (Sommer et al., 1990, Science 249:1580-1585). (ii) A decrease in the sensitivity to cyclothiazide (Johansen et al., 1995, Mol. Pharm. 48:946-955; Partin et al., 1994, Neuron 14:833-843) and an increase in the sensitivity to PEPA (Sekiguchi et al., 1998, Br. J. Pharmacol. 123:1294-1303). (iii) A decrease in sensitivity for glutamate (Partin et al., 1995, Neuron 14:833-843; Sommer et al., 1990, Science 249:1580-1585). 
     NSC-34 cells have also been shown to efficiently uptake SMOs in culture (Rembach et al., 2004, J. Neurosci. Res. 77:573-582). Briefly, SMOs are complexed with lipofectamine and applied to NSC-34 cells (100 â–¡M SMO) in reduced serum medium for 4-6 hours (to induce differentiation (Eggett et al., 2000, J. Neurochem. 74:1895-1902; Rembach et al., 2004, J. Neurosci. Res. 77:573-582). Medium is replaced and cells grown for an additional 24-48 hours in serum-containing medium and harvested. Cells are lysed, total RNA extracted (Trizol), and cDNA generated with a reverse transcriptase (MultiScribe) using dNTPs and random hexamers. The level of both flip- and flop-containing mRNA transcripts is determined using real-time PCR using the TaqMan PCR system.

     FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
     This invention is in the field of medicinal chemistry. In particular, the invention relates to a new class of small-molecules having a benzoic acid structure which function as inhibitors of Mcl-1 protein, and their use as therapeutics for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. 
     INTRODUCTION 
     A hallmark of cancer cells is defects in the apoptotic cell death program (see, e.g., Hanahan D, et al., Cell. 2000; 100:57-70; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). The broad resistance of many types of cancers to existing chemotherapeutic agents and radiation therapy is due, in large part, to defects in apoptotic signaling pathways. 
     Improved methods for preventing and/or repairing defects in apoptotic signaling pathways are needed. 
     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
     Mcl-1 is a potent anti-apoptotic protein and an important survival factor for many human cancers, including breast, pancreatic, colon, lung, ovarian, prostate, melanoma, multiple myeloma, and acute myeloid leukemia. Mcl-1 is highly amplified in human cancer and its overexpression has been associated with tumor initiation, progression and resistance to current anticancer therapies. Recent independent studies using a genetic approach to down-regulation of Mcl-1 provided a significant proof-of-concept that selective, small-molecule Mcl-1 inhibitors may have potential as a new treatment for human cancers by overcoming",0.03

The patent in question is titled Development and use of cysteine-labeled fluorescent probes of unbound analytes.  The extract of text citing that article is: 45:14263-14274 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,601,510, which is incorporated herein by reference). Although labeling at the lysine position with environmentally sensitive fluorophores such as acrylodan results in probes that produce a fluorescence ratio change that is sensitive to ligand binding, we have found that the fluorophore labeling stoichiometry, the heterogeneity of labeling and the stability of the fluorophore-protein chemical bond, is mutant dependent. For example, acrylodan labeling of SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:2 with an L72A substitution, produce probes that are virtually completely labeled at a single lysine position (Lys 27) (for example,  FIG. 2A . However, acrylodan labeling of other SEQ ID NO:2 muteins (SEQ ID NO:4) can result in probes that are not completely labeled and/or are labeled at more than a single position (for example  FIG. 3 ). 
     Incompletely labeled muteins yield â€œprobesâ€ that are mixtures of fluorescently labeled and unlabeled muteins. As described previously (Richieri et al J. Biol. Chem. (1992) 267:23495-23501) the ligand (analyte) binding affinity is generally different for the labeled and unlabeled mutein and is usually smaller for the fluorescently labeled mutein than the unlabeled mutein. Moreover, typical variation in lysine labeling reaction conditions may result in lot-to-lot differences in the fraction of labeled and unlabeled mutein. This is an issue because the unbound ligand or analyte concentration determined using a probe that is a mixture of labeled and unlabeled mutein may be dependent upon the fraction of unlabeled mutein. This can occur because a significant fraction of the carrier (for example albumin) bound ligands (analytes) bind to the unlabeled mutein fraction of the probe solution. This effect may be exacerbated in the event that only a small fraction of the mutein is fluorescently labeled and therefore larger amounts of probe are required to yield a sufficiently intense fluorescence signal. Targeting lysine residues for fluorescence labeling is also ",0.02

In certain embodiments, a hierarchically porous material comprising Pd nanoparticles, Ni nanoparticles, Cu nanoparticles, or combinations thereof, is used to catalyze a Heck reaction. 
     Hierarchically porous material containing metal nanoparticles can be used to catalyze Suzuki coupling reactions. Generally, Suzuki reactions involve contacting an organohalide and an organoborane with a suitable catalyst in the presence of a base. For example, the organohalide can be an unsaturated halide, such as an aryl or vinyl halide. The organoborane can be an unsaturated boronic acid, such as an aryl- or vinyl-boronic acid. Boronic esters and organotrifluoroborate salts may be used instead of boronic acids. Suzuki reactions can also be used to couple pseudohalides, such as triflates (OTf), with organoboranes. Suzuki reactions are known in the art. See, for example, Miyaura, N. and Suzuki, A.  Chem. Rev.  95:2457 (1995), Stanforth, S. P.

The patent in question is titled Recurrent gene fusions in cancer.  The extract of text citing that article is: . 5â€² FGFR fusions to BICC1, AFF3, CASP7, CCDC6, KIAA1967, OFD1, BAIAP2L1 and TACC3 (multiple exons) were identified and 3â€² FGFR fusions to SLC45A3, BAG4 and ERLIN2 were identified. Cancer types harboring FGFR fusions were quite diverse and included cholangiocarcinoma (n=2), breast cancer (n=4), prostate cancer (n=1), thyroid cancer (n=1), lung squamous cell carcinoma (n=6), bladder cancer (n=5), oral cancer (n=1), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (n=2), and glioblastoma (n=2). FGFRs are known to exhibit tissue-specific splicing, resulting in IIIb and IIIc isoforms (Turner et al., Nat. Rev. cancer 10, 116 92010). Both IIIb and IIIc isoforms of FGFR2 and FGFR3 were evident in the RNA-seq data of the fusion cases, depending on cancer type (Table 12). 
     As many of the expressed domains contributed by the diverse FGFR fusion partners have previously been suggested as dimerization motifs (Browman et al., Trends Cell Biol 17, 394-402 (2007); Chai, J. et al. Cell 107, 399-407 (2001); Ishizaki, T. et al. FEBS Lett 404, 118-24 (1997); Knight et al., Protein Sci 20, 1697-706 (2011); Mateja et al., J Mol Biol 357, 621-31 (2006); Peter, B. J. et al. Science 303, 495-9 (2004); Tong, Q. et al. Oncogene 10, 1781-7 (1995)), it was contemplated that oligomerization may serve as the common mechanism of activation of FGFR fusion proteins. Thus, selected epitope tagged versions of the FGFR fusions were expressed in HEK 293T cells protein oligomerization was assayed by co-immunoprecipitation. As examples, while FGFR3-BAIAP2L1, FGFR3-TACC3, FGFR2-BICC1, and FGFR2-CCDC6 interact in vitro, wild-type FGFR2 and FGFR3 do not in the absence of FGF ligands ( FIG. 3 a   ,  FIG. 6 ). It was also shown that the isolated fusion domains provided by BAIAP2L1, TACC3, KIAA1967, CCDC6, and BICC1 interact in vitro as oligomerization domains ( FIG. 7 ), further supporting the notion of oligomerization induced activation of FGFR kinase fusions.

The patent in question is titled Vitamins C and K for treating polycystic diseases.  The extract of text citing that article is:  VC treatment groups were given vitamin C at a concentration of 15 g/L in drinking water. The VK3 treatment groups were given vitamin K 3  at a concentration of 0.15 g/L in drinking water. The APATONEÂ® treatment groups were given vitamins C and K3 at concentrations of 15 g/L and 0.15 g/L, respectively, in drinking water. The control groups were given drinking water only. Rats or mice in each group were allowed to drink freely. 
     The rats and mice were sacrificed after 6 weeks of treatment. The following parameters were analyzed: body weights, liver and kidney weights, serum biochemistry, renal and hepatic cystic and fibrotic areas, apoptotic and proliferation indices, expression of Cdc25A and its down-stream targets. 
     Since no differences was observed in liver and kidney weights between male and female PCK rats and Pkd2 WS25/âˆ’  mice, male and female data were combined for statistical analysis. Cystic and fibrotic areas were analyzed according to the procedures as described in Masyuk et al.,  Gastroenterology  2007, 132, 1104-1116. Briefly, livers and kidney sections were stained with H&amp;E or picrosirius red collagen to assess, respectively, cystic or fibrotic areas. Measurements were done by Meta-Morph software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, Pa.), following image acquisition using a light microscope and color digital camera (Nikon DXM 1200). Hepatic and renal cystic and fibrotic areas were expressed as a percent of total hepatic or renal parenchyma, respectively.

The patent in question is titled Methods for producing an immune response to tuberculosis.  The extract of text citing that article is:  microcapsules, nanocapsules, nanospheres, and nanoparticles. Microcapsules contain the therapeutic protein as a central core. In microspheres, the therapeutic agent is dispersed throughout the particle. Particles, microspheres, and microcapsules smaller than about 1 Î¼m are generally referred to as nanoparticles, nanospheres, and nanocapsules, respectively. Capillaries have a diameter of approximately 5 Î¼m so that only nanoparticles are administered intravenously. Microparticles are typically around 100 Î¼m in diameter and are administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly (see Kreuter,  Colloidal Drug Delivery Systems , J. Kreuter, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., pp. 219-342, 1994; Tice &amp; Tabibi,  Treatise on Controlled Drug Delivery , A. Kydonieus, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York, N.Y., pp. 315-339, 1992). 
     Polymers can be used for controlled release. Various degradable and nondegradable polymeric matrices for use in controlled drug delivery are known in the art (Langer,  Accounts Chem. Res.  26:537, 1993). For example, the block copolymer, polaxamer 407 exists as a viscous yet mobile liquid at low temperatures but forms a semisolid gel at body temperature. It has shown to be an effective vehicle for formulation and sustained delivery of recombinant interleukin-2 and urease (Johnston et al.,  Pharm. Res.  9:425, 1992; and Pec,  J. Parent. Sci. Tech.  44(2):58, 1990). Alternatively, hydroxyapatite has been used as a microcarrier for controlled release of proteins (Ijntema et al.,  InL J. Pharm.  112:215, 1994). In yet another aspect, liposomes are used for controlled release as well as drug targeting of the lipid-capsulated drug (Betageri et al.,  Liposome Drug Delivery Systems , Technomic Publishing Co., Inc., Lancaster, Pa., 1993).

The patent in question is titled Demand shaping in an electrical power grid using day ahead market and real time market prices.  The extract of text citing that article is: als. Demand shaping mechanisms are among the most crucial ones, since they allow the grid operators to control and shape the demand, reduce costs and peak to average consumption, as well as increase reliability and better control blackouts and brownouts. 
     The current smart grid approaches and related work may be organized generally into two main categories: demand response (DR) methods and grid/market modeling. Several different methods for demand response have been proposed in the literature. A good summary of the different DR approaches is presented in an article by M. Albadi and E. El-Saadany entitled â€œDemand response in electricity markets: An overviewâ€, Power Engineering Society General Meeting (2007), pp. 1-5, IEEE, and in their follow up article entitled â€œA summary of demand response in electricity marketsâ€, Electric Power Systems Research 78, No. 11 (November 2008), pp. 1989-1996. An additional, interesting source of DR approach results can be found in an article by J.-H. Kim and A. Shcherbakova entitled â€œCommon failures of demand responseâ€, Energy 36, No. 2 (February 2011), pp. 873-880, in which the authors list several implementations and trials done as well as the shortcomings they have observed, shedding light into which methods are better for controlling demand level. 
     The simplest approach of demand response methods is the direct control, which basically uses the ideas of dynamic demand implemented in Great Britain. An elaborate example of that approach appears in an article by G. Tejeda and A. Cipriano entitled â€œDirect Load Control of HVAC systems using Hybrid Modelâ€, Predictive Control (2012), in which the authors control a HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) load directly. Their approach comes from the control theory perspective but, if the objective functions are changed for other economic quantities, a control system could be implemented that minimizes a desired metric, like generation cost or peak to average ratio (PAR), for electrical power grid purposes.

In one particular embodiment of the invention, Compound 1 is combined with an aldosterone antagonist, a Î² 1 -adrenergic receptor antagonist, an AT 1  receptor antagonist, or a diuretic, and used to treat congestive heart failure. 
     Diarrhea 
     As a NEP inhibitor, the Compound 1 is expected to inhibit the degradation of endogenous enkephalins and thus such compounds may also find utility for the treatment of diarrhea, including infectious and secretory/watery diarrhea. See, for example, Baumer et al. (1992) Gut 33:753-758; Farthing (2006) Digestive Diseases 24:47-58; and MarÃ§ais-Collado (1987)  Eur. J. Pharmacol.  144(2):125-132. When used to treat diarrhea, Compound 1 may be combined with one or more additional antidiarrheal agents. 
     Renal Diseases 
     By potentiating the effects of vasoactive peptides like the natriuretic peptides and bradykinin, Compound 1 is expected to enhance renal function (see Chen et al. (1999)  Circulation  100:2443-2448; Lipkin et al. (1997)  Kidney Int.  52:792-801; and Dussaule et al. (1993)  Clin. Sci.  84:31-39) and find utility in treating and/or preventing renal diseases in a renally-impaired subject. Renal diseases of particular interest include diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease, proteinuria, and particularly acute kidney injury (caused, for example, by cardiovascular surgery, chemotherapy, or the use of contrast dyes in medical imaging) or acute renal failure (see Sharkovska et al. (2011)  Clin. Lab.  57:507-515 and Newaz et al. (2010)  Renal Failure  32:384-390). 
     A renally-impaired subject that has chronic kidney disease (CKD) may be classified according to the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF KDOQI) Guidelines. Once chronic kidney disease is established, i.e., kidney damage or glomerular filtration rate (GFR)&lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m 2  for â‰§3 months, the stage of disease may be assigned according to KDOQI CK",0.49

The patent in question is titled B7 family member zB7H6 and related compositions and methods.  The extract of text citing that article is: as, for example, acridine orange or ethidium bromide). A method for measuring apoptotic cell number has previously been described by Duke and Cohen,  Current Protocols In Immunology  (Coligan et al. eds., 1992, pp. 3.17.1-3.17.16). Cells can be also labeled with a DNA dye (e.g., acridine orange, ethidium bromide, or propidium iodide) and the cells observed for chromatin condensation and margination along the inner nuclear membrane. Other morphological changes that can be measured to determine apoptosis include, e.g., cytoplasmic condensation, increased membrane blebbing, and cellular shrinkage. 
     The presence of apoptotic cells can be measured in both the attached and â€œfloatingâ€ compartments of the cultures. For example, both compartments can be collected by removing the supernatant, trypsining the attached cells, combining the preparations following a centrifugation wash step (e.g., 10 minutes, 2000 rpm), and detecting apoptosis (e.g., by measuring DNA fragmentation).

     Inhaled Nebulized Nitrite is a Pulmonary Vasodilator 
     Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn occurs with an incidence of 0.43-6.8/1,000 live births and is associated with mortality rates between 10-20% (Walsh-Sukys et al.,  Pediatrics  105, 14-20, 2000). Survivors may develop neurodevelopmental and audiological impairment (46%), cognitive delays (30%), hearing loss (19%) and a high rate of rehospitalization (22%) (Lipkin et al.,  J Pediatr  140, 306-10, 2002). 
     Pulmonary hypertension occurs as a primary or idiopathic disease (Runo &amp; Loyd,  Lancet  361:1533-44, 2003; Trembath &amp; Harrison,  Pediatr Res  53:883-8, 2003), as well as secondary to a number of systemic and pulmonary diseases (Rubin,  N Engl J Med  336:111-7, 1997). Regardless of etiology, pulmonary hypertension is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Newborn infants and adults with pulmonary disease often develop systemic hypoxemia, reduced oxyhemoglobin saturation and increased pulmonary vascular resistance (Rubin,  N Engl J Med  336:111-7, 1997; Haworth,  Heart  88:658-64, 2002). Therapeutically administered inhaled nitric oxide (NO) decreases pulmonary vascular resistance in newborns and adults and improves ventilation-to-perfusion matching and oxygenation; in newborns, inhaled NO reduces chronic lung damage and reduces the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Randomized placebo-controlled trials of inhaled NO therapy for term and near-term newborns with severe hypoxic respiratory failure demonstrated an improvement in hypoxemia and reduced need for extracorporal membrane oxygenation (Clark et al.,  N Engl J Med  342, 469-74, 2000; Roberts et al.,  N Engl J Med  336, 605-10, 1997; The Neonatal Inhaled Nitric Oxide S",0.02

The patent in question is titled Substituted indazoles for targeting Hsp90.  The extract of text citing that article is: complete blocking of Hsp90 binding as well as several N-terminal fragments. MS analysis demonstrated that all of the recovered proteins were Hsp90 or proteolytic fragments of the protein, suggesting that this resin is selective for Hsp90 over GRP94 and TRAP-1. Resin D was more selective than A and B, although some non-specific binding was observed. 
     Following exposure of resin E to pig mammary gland extract and treatment with 25 mM sodium dithionite, the eluted proteins were identified by MS. The retained protein profile ( FIG. 1 , lane E) was essentially identical to resin C, except that the proteins were recovered using non-denaturing conditions. 
     Example 10. Additional Selectivity Studies 
     To further explore the selectivity, the elution of pig mammary gland proteins from gamma phosphate linked ATP Sepharose was studied with compound 8, as well as known potent Hsp90 inhibitors PU-H71 (Caldas-Lopes et al.  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA  106(20), 8368 (2009)) and SNX-2112 (Chandarlapaty et al.  Clin. Cancer Res.  14(1) 240 (2008)). This ATP resin has been used previously to study purine-binding proteins (Graves et al.  Mol. Pharmacol.  2002, 62, 1364) and to discover novel Hsp90 inhibitors (Huang et al.  J. Med. Chem.  2009, 52, 4288.) 
     The ATP resin was charged with the pig mammary gland extract and aliquots were distributed into individual wells. Proteins eluted from the wells with increasing amounts of indicated compound were analyzed as described above; results are illustrated in  FIG. 2 . Compound PU-H71 demonstrates strong potency towards both Hsp90 and GRP94, whereas SNX-2112 shows weaker affinity for GRP94. Compound 8 shows essentially no elution of GRP94.

The patent in question is titled Compositions and methods for producing isoprene free of C5 hydrocarbons under decoupling conditions and/or safe operating ranges.  The extract of text citing that article is: ents of polypeptides, peptides, and fusions polypeptides that have at least one activity of an isoprene synthase polypeptide. Standard methods can be used to determine whether a polypeptide has isoprene synthase polypeptide activity by measuring the ability of the polypeptide to convert DMAPP into isoprene in vitro, in a cell extract, or in vivo. In an exemplary assay, cell extracts are prepared by growing a strain (e.g., the  E. coli /pTrcKudzu strain described herein) in the shake flask method as described in Example 1. After induction is complete, approximately 10 mL of cells are pelleted by centrifugation at 7000Ã—g for 10 minutes and resuspended in 5 ml of PEB without glycerol. The cells are lysed using a French Pressure cell using standard procedures. Alternatively the cells are treated with lysozyme (Ready-Lyse lysozyme solution; EpiCentre) after a freeze/thaw at âˆ’80 C. 
     Isoprene synthase polypeptide activity in the cell extract can be measured, for example, as described in Silver et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:13010-13016, 1995 and references therein, which are each hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties, particularly with respect to assays for isoprene synthase polypeptide activity.

PI3K-Î´ and/or Î³ inhibitors may have unique therapeutic potential in T-cell malignancies. 
     In neutrophils, PI3K-Î´, along with PI3K-Î³, contribute to the responses to immune complexes, FCÎ³RII signaling, including migration and neutrophil respiratory burst. Human neutrophils undergo rapid induction of PIP3 in response to formyl peptide receptor (FMLP) or complement component C5a (C5a) in a PI3K-Î³ dependent manner, followed by a longer PIP3 production period that is PI3K-Î´ dependent, and is essential for respiratory burst. The response to immune complexes is contributed by PI3K-Î´, PI3K-Î³, and PI3K-Î², and is an important mediator of tissue damage in models of autoimmune disease (Randis T M et al. (2008)  Eur J Immunol.  38(5):1215-24; Pinho V, (2007)  J  Immunol. 179(11):7891-8; Sadhu C. et al. (2003)  J Immunol.  170(5):2647-54; Condliffe A M et al. (2005)  Blood  106(4):1432-40). It has been reported that in certain autoimmune diseases, preferential activation of PI3K-Î² may be involved (Kulkarni et al.,  Immunology  (2011) 4(168) ra23: 1-11). It was also reported that PI3K-Î²-deficient mice were highly protected in an FcÎ³R-dependent model of autoantibody-induced skin blistering and partially protected in an FcÎ³R-dependent model of inflammatory arthritis, whereas combined deficiency of PI3K-Î² and PI3K-Î´ resulted in near complete protection in inflammatory arthritis (Id.). 
     In macrophages collected from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), glucocorticoid responsiveness can be restored by treatment of the cells with inhibitors of PI3K-Î´. Macrophages also rely on PI3K-Î´ and PI3K-Î³ for responses to immune complexes through the arthus reaction (FCÎ³R and C5a signaling) (Randis T M, et al.

The patent in question is titled Plant regulatory elements and uses thereof.  The extract of text citing that article is: ide molecule and may include polynucleotides that provide a polyadenylation signal and other regulatory signals capable of affecting transcription, mRNA processing, or gene expression. PolyA tails are thought to function in mRNA stability and in initiation of translation. Examples of 3â€² transcription termination molecules are the nopaline synthase 3â€² region (see, Fraley, et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,  80: 4803-4807 (1983)); wheat hsp17 3â€² region; pea rubisco small subunit 3â€² region; cotton E6 3â€² region (U.S. Pat. No. 6,096,950); 3â€² regions disclosed in WO0011200A2; and the coixin 3â€² UTR (U.S. Pat. No. 6,635,806). 
     3â€² UTRs typically find beneficial use for the recombinant expression of specific genes. In animal systems, a machinery of 3â€² UTRs has been well defined (e.g. Zhao et al.,  Microbiol Mol Biol Rev  63:405-445 (1999); Proudfoot,  Nature  322:562-565 (1986); Kim et al.,  Biotechnology Progress  19:1620-1622 (2003); Yonaha and Proudfoot,  EMBO J.  19:3770-3777 (2000); Cramer et al.,  FEBS Letters  498:179-182 (2001); Kuerstem and Goodwin,  Nature Reviews Genetics  4:626-637 (2003)). Effective termination of RNA transcription is required to prevent unwanted transcription of trait-unrelated (downstream) sequences, which may interfere with trait performance. Arrangement of multiple gene expression cassettes in local proximity to one another (e.g. within one T-DNA) may cause suppression of gene expression of one or more genes in said construct in comparison to independent insertions (Padidam and Cao,  BioTechniques  31:328-334 (2001). This may interfere with achieving adequate levels of expression, for instance in cases were strong gene expression from all cassettes is desired. 
     In plants, clearly defined polyadenylation signal sequences are not known. Hasegawa et al.,  Plant J.  33:1063-1072, (2003)) were not able to identify conserved polyadenylation signal sequences in both in vitro and in vivo systems in  Nicotiana sylvestris  and to determine the actual length of the primary (non-polyadeny",0.62

The patent in question is titled Methods of treating various cancers using an AXL/cMET inhibitor in combination with other agents.  The extract of text citing that article is: origenicity, enhanced angiogenesis, protection of carcinoma cells from apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents such as adriamycin, ultraviolet light, and ionizing radiation, and enhanced rate of repair of DNA strand breaks [Comoglio et. al J.

Based upon these data, HGF may enhance mutagenicity following DNA damage, allowing tumor cells with genetic damage to survive, and thus leading to resistance to chemo- and radiotherapeutic treatment regimens (Fan et. al, Mol.

Due to the pleiotropic, pro-tumorigenic activities of the HGF-c-MET axis, inhibiting this pathway would be predicted to have potent anti-tumor effects in many common cancers through multiple complimentary mechanisms.

Cells may be grown for shorter periods prior to induction. Cells are usually induced for about 12-50 hours, although longer or shorter induction time may be used. 
     To improve the production yield and quality of the polypeptides of the invention, various fermentation conditions can be modified. For example, to improve the proper assembly and folding of the secreted heteromultimeric proteins (e.g., antibodies), additional vectors overexpressing chaperone proteins, such as Dsb proteins (DsbA, DsbB, DsbC, DsbD and or DsbG) or FkpA (a peptidylprolyl cis,trans-isomerase with chaperone activity) can be used to co-transform the host prokaryotic cells. The chaperone proteins have been demonstrated to facilitate the proper folding and solubility of heterologous proteins produced in bacterial host cells. Chen et al.

     To minimize proteolysis of expressed heterologous proteins (especially those that are proteolytically sensitive), certain host strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes can be used for the present invention. For example, host cell strains may be modified to effect genetic mutation(s) in the genes encoding known bacterial proteases such as Protease III, OmpT, DegP, Tsp, Protease I, Protease Mi, Protease V, Protease VI and combinations thereof.

The patent in question is titled Method of producing succinic acid and other chemicals using sucrose-containing feedstock.  The extract of text citing that article is: tween the two csc operons, and these differences are scattered throughout the operon. Many of the point mutations in the EC3132 operon cause non-conservative changes in protein sequences, and some of the mutations were in promoter regions, so it must be the case that the operon from EC3132 is simply defective due to one or more of these mutations. Faster growing spontaneous mutants with a doubling time on sucrose of down to 50 minutes could be isolated from EC3132, but when the mutated cscAKB operons were installed in a K-12 strain, the doubling time on sucrose medium increased back up to 75 minutes at best (Jahreis et al., 2002). None of the mutated csc operons from EC3132 changed the DNA sequence to be more like the efficient operon of ATCC 9637. As such, it appears that the operon disclosed by Jahreis et al (2002) is not as desirable as that of ATCC 9637. 
     Another approach that has been proposed to enable sucrose utilization is to simply engineer a strain to secrete invertase (Lee et al., 2010a). In this case the invertase from  Mannheimia succiniproducens  was shown to be superior to the invertase from  E. coli  W, teaching away from the use of the  E. coli  W invertase. Moreover, in bacteria, this approach is inherently less efficient than importing the sucrose before cleaving it, since after cleavage to glucose and fructose by invertase, two sugar molecules must be imported rather than just one, and this requires more energy to be expended. Moreover, in this prior art example, during fermentation starting with 20 g/l sucrose, external fructose accumulated to over 10 g/l, and it took 50 hours for this external fructose to be completely consumed (Lee et al., 2010b). Thus, although a sucrose utilizing strain was disclosed, the system had performance characteristics that were not commercially attractive. Secretion of fructose by  E. coli  strains grown on sucrose is a general problem, and the fructose that remains at the end of a desirable fermentation time, which is often 4",0.71

The patent in question is titled Use of gelsolin to treat infections.  The extract of text citing that article is:  Gelsolin and Gelsolin Analogsâ€ incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. 
    
    
     FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
     The invention is directed to the use of gelsolin to treat infections and sepsis and to the use of gelsolin to monitor and evaluate treatments of infections. The invention also provides methods for up-regulating interleukin expression and methods for down-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. 
     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     Despite significant advances in diagnosis and therapy, infections and sepsis remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Even with aggressive management, many patients with severe infections develop complications and some die. Sepsis claims more than 200,000 lives in the United States annually (Angus, D. C. &amp; Wax, R. S. (2001)  Crit Care Med  29, S109-16). An intense inflammatory response accompanies the early phase of sepsis with markedly increased plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Riedemann, N. C., Guo, R. F. &amp; Ward, P. A. (2003)  Nat Med  29, 517-24), in addition to other biochemical abnormalities. Much concerted research has gone into attempts at inhibition of specific inflammatory mediators in hope of developing pharmacologic treatments for sepsis. Nevertheless, activated protein C (APC) is the only drug proven to reduce the mortality of severe sepsis with an absolute reduction of death by 6% (Bernard, G. R., Vincent, J. L., Laterre, P. F., LaRosa, S. P., Dhainaut, J. F., Lopez-Rodriguez, A., Steingrub, J. S., Garber, G. E., Helterbrand, J. D., Ely, E. W. &amp; Fisher, C. J., Jr. (2001)  N Engl J Med  344, 699-709). 
     The negative health effects of infections and sepsis provide a strong incentive to identify new treatments as well as improved tests and approaches to evaluate therapy of infections and sepsis. 
     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
     This invention is based on the surprising discovery that gelsolin treats infections and protects against the toxic manifestations of infections. We have found t",0.37

In some embodiments there is at least 85% noncomplementarity, at least 70% noncomplementarity or at least 50% noncomplementarity. 
     Properties of Polymerases 
     By selecting a polymerase with minimal or no endonuclease activity, and possessing sufficient strand displacement activity, the regulatory oligonucleotide is displaced by the polymerase rather than digested. 
     A preferred DNA polymerase for the PCR amplification steps of the present method is (a) thermostable and (b) lacks, or has reduced, 5â€² nuclease activity. A preferred DNA polymerase for the PCR amplification steps of the present method additionally exhibits strong strand displacement activity. Polymerases useful in such reactions are readily available and include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,108,892, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety, as well as those enzymes described in Lawyer et al., 1993 , Genome Res.  2, 275-278, 1993, and Kong et al., 1993 , J. Biol. Chem.  268, 1965-1975, both incorporated herein by reference. 
     Taq polymerase (DNA polymerase I from  Thermus aquaticus ) is commonly used in PCR reactions. Taq polymerase catalyzes the hydrolysis of polynucleotides bound to the template DNA strand as it translocates along this strand. Lyamichev et al. demonstrated that Taq polymerase can, when approaching a â€œfrayedâ€ DNA duplex with a free 5â€² arm, cleave the 5â€² arm endonucleolytically near the end of the duplex (Lyamichev et al., 1993 , Science  260, 778-783). In addition to the oligonucleotides resulting from such cleavage, Taq polymerase also generates mononucleotides resulting from 5â€² exonuclease digestion of the DNA strand from which the 5â€² arm is cleaved (Holland et al., 1991 , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA  88:7276-7280). Accordingly, Lyamichev at al. coined the term â€œ5â€² nucleaseâ€ to refer to the 5â€²43â€² endonuclease and exonuclease activities of Taq polymerase taken together (Lyamichev et al., 1993 , Science  260, 77",0.99

     In clinical settings, the gene delivery systems for the therapeutic gene can be introduced into a subject by any of a number of methods, each of which is familiar in the art. For instance, a pharmaceutical preparation of the gene delivery system can be introduced systemically, e.g., by intravenous injection, and specific transduction of the protein in the target cells will occur predominantly from specificity of transfection, provided by the gene delivery vehicle, cell-type or tissue-type expression due to the transcriptional regulatory sequences controlling expression of the receptor gene, or a combination thereof. In other embodiments, initial delivery of the recombinant gene is more limited, with introduction into the subject being quite localized. For example, the gene delivery vehicle can be introduced by catheter (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,328,470) or by stereotactic injection (e.g., Chen et al., PNAS USA 91: 3054-3057 (1994)). 
     The pharmaceutical preparation of the gene therapy construct can consist essentially of the gene delivery system in an acceptable diluent, or can comprise a slow release matrix in which the gene delivery vehicle is embedded.

Feldman and J. Kelsey, eds., Academic Press, San Diego, 1996. p. 1210, Table 1). 
     Although bisphosphonates have therapeutically beneficial properties, they suffer from pharmacological disadvantages as orally administered agents. One drawback is low oral availability: as little as 0.7% to 5% of an orally administered dose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Oral absorption is further reduced when taken with food. Further, it is known that some currently available bisphosphonates, e.g., FOSAMAXâ„¢ (Merck; alendronate sodium), SKELIDâ„¢ (Sanofi, tiludronate) and ACTONEâ„¢ (Procter and Gamble, risedronate) have local toxicity, causing esophageal irritation and ulceration. Other bisphosphonates, like amino-olpadronate, lack anti-resorptive effects (Van Beek, E. et al., J. Bone Miner Res 11(10):1492-1497 (1996) but inhibit osteocyte apoptosis and are able to stimulate net bone formation (Plotkin, L. et al., J Clin Invest 104(10):1363-1374 (1999) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,973). It would therefore, be useful to develop chemically modified bisphosphonate derivatives that maintain or enhance the pharmacological activity of the parent compounds while eliminating or reducing their undesirable side effects. 
     In addition to bisphosphonates, monophosphonates are also known to provide therapeutic benefits. One class of therapeutically beneficial monophosphonates are the antiviral nucleotide phosphonates, such as, for example, cidofovir, cyclic cidofovir, adefovir, tenofovir, and the like, as well as the 5â€²-phosphonates and methylene phosphonates of azidothymidine, ganciclovir, acyclovir, and the like. In compounds of this type, the 5â€²-hydroxyl of the sugar moiety, or its equivalent in acyclic nucleosides (ganciclovir, penciclovir, acyclovir) which do not contain a complete sugar moiety, is replaced with a phosphorus-carbon bond. In the case of the methylene phosphonates, a methylene group replaces the 5â€²-hydroxyl or its equivalent,",0.53

The patent in question is titled Antigen binding proteins that bind ErbB3.  The extract of text citing that article is: rectal cancers, and bone invasion in prostate cancer (Sithanandam et al., 2008 , Cancer Gene Therapy  15:413). Overexpression of ErbB3 has been linked to resistance to several cancer treatments, including treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and head and neck cancers, treatment with Her2 inhibitor in breast cancers, and treatment with radiotherapy in pancreatic cancers. Moreover, overexpression of NRG, a ligand for ErbB3, was also linked to resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Chen et al. describe the use of anti-ErbB3 monoclonal antibodies that inhibit NRG function and show growth inhibitory activity against breast and ovarian cancer cells (Chen et al., 1996 , J. Biol. Chem.  271: 7620). 
     ErbB3 has been found to be overexpressed in breast (Lemoine et al.,  Br. J. Cancer,  66:1116-1121 (1992)), gastrointestinal (Poller et al.,  J. Pathol.,  168:275-280 (1992), Rajkumer et al.,  J.

The patent in question is titled Inhibition of pulmonary fibrosis with nutlin-3A and peptides.  The extract of text citing that article is: proliferation compared to FL-fibroblasts exposed to CP or Ad-EV. FL-fibroblasts from BLM mice express remarkably low levels of caveolin-1 and expression of caveolin-1 mitigates excess production of ECM. Therefore, FL-fibroblasts are transduced with Ad-Cav-1 to see whether p53 and p53-mediated downstream changes in uPA fibrinolytic system, ECM and cellular viability are reduced compared to those treated with Ad-EV. 
     D. Role of Nutlin-3a- or CSP-4-Mediated in Inhibition of Akt Phosphorylation in Mitigation of Lung Fibrosis. 
     FL-fibroblasts display elevated phosphorylation of Akt and expression of PDGFR-Î² which provides survival signals (Stambolic V et al.  Mol Cell  8:317-25, 2001; Li J et al.  J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol  23:253-66, 2004; Hoyle G W et al.  Am J Pathol  154:1763-75, 1999; Meinecke A K et al.  Blood  14:119:5931-42, 2012) Further, p53 augments expression of PTEN (Stambolic et al., supra; Mayo L D, et al.  J Biol Chem  277:5484-89, 2002) and inhibits PDGFR-Î² (Widau R C et al.,  Mol Cell Biol  32:4270-82, 2012; Thornton J D et al.,  Cell Cycle  4:1316-9, 2005) whereas PAI-1 inhibits Akt phosphorylation (Shetty S K et al., 2012, supra; Stambolic et al., supra, Malinowsky K et al.  Transl Oncol  5:98-104, 2012). Transduction of FL-fibroblasts with Ad-Cav-1 inhibits phosphorylation of Akt through increased PTEN activity (Tourkina E et al.  Open Rheumatol J.  6:116-22, 2012; Wang X M et al.  J Exp Med  203:2895-906, 2006; Xia H et al.  Am J Pathol  176:2626-37, 2010) 
     Results provided herein showed that nutlin-3a and CSP-4 augment p53 and repress production of ECM in FL-fibroblasts, and mitigate BLM-induced lung fibrosis. The present inventors therefore conceived that inhibition of Akt and PDGFR-Î² survival signals in FL-fibroblasts, due to induction of p53 and changes in p53-uPA fibrinolytic system cross-talk, mitigates fibrosis. To test this, FL-fibroblasts from BLM injured mouse lungs are tested for phosphorylation of Akt and expression of PDGFR-Î². The responses are compared with fibroblasts extracted from mice treated with nutlin-3a or CSP-4 or CP after BLM injury. FL-fibroblasts from BLM injured mice are expected to have minimum baseline p53 expression and elevated phosphorylation of",0.65

These include, for example, the addition of volume excluding chemicals such as polyethylene glycols (PEG) and a variety of gene amplification techniques, including transcription using RNA polymerases including those from bacteria such as  E. coli  (Roberts, 1969; Blattner and Dahlberg, 1972; Roberts et al., 1975; Rosenberg et al., 1975), eukaryotes e.g. (Weil et al., 1979; Manley et al., 1983) and bacteriophage such as T7, T3 and SP6 (Melton et al., 1984); the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Saiki et al., 1988); Q.beta. replicase amplification (Miele et al., 1983; Cahill et al., 1991; Chetverin and Spirin, 1995; Katanaev et al., 1995); the ligase chain reaction (LCR) (Landegren et al., 1988; Barany, 1991); and self-sustained sequence replication system (Fahy et al., 1991) and strand displacement amplification (Walker et al., 1992). Even gene amplification techniques requiring thermal cycling such as PCR and LCR could be used if the emulsions and the in vitro transcription or coupled transcription-translation systems are thermostable (for example, the coupled transcription-translation systems could be made from a thermostable organism such as  Thermus aquaticus ). Increasing the effective local nucleic acid concentration enables larger microcapsules to be used effectively. 
     The microcapsule size must be sufficiently large to accommodate all of the required components of the biochemical reactions that are needed to occur within the microcapsule. For example, in vitro, both transcription reactions and coupled transcription-translation reactions require a total nucleoside triphosphate concentration of about 2 mM.",0.84

     BACKGROUND 
     The basis for phononic crystals-dates back to Isaac Newton who imagined that sound waves propagated through air in the same way that an elastic wave would propagate along a lattice of point masses connected by springs with an elastic force constant E, the force constant being identical to the modulus of the material. The field of phononic crystals and our theoretical understanding of them have steadily grown since that time (see, for example, Joannopoulos, R. D. Meade and J. N. Winn,  Photonic Crystals, Molding the Flow of Light  (Princeton University Press, Princeton (1995); Garcia et al., â€œTheory for Tailoring Sonic Devices: Diffraction Dominates over Refraction,â€  Phys.

The patent in question is titled Methods and compositions for producing a chimeric polypeptide.  The extract of text citing that article is: 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, or 99.5% of nucleotides present in the site-specific recombination motif. Complementary recombination motifs may include, e.g., a phage motif, a bacterial motif, or a direct repeat motif. In some instances, a segment of a nucleic acid may serve as both a recombination motif and, when translated into its corresponding amino acid sequence, a linker between two polypeptide moieties (e.g., VH and VL protein, as shown in  FIG. 1 ). 
     Exemplary recombination motifs that may be used as recombination motifs in vectors of the invention include, without limitation: attB, attP, loxP, FRT, hixL, hixR and variants thereof. Variants of recombination motifs are known in the art (e.g., JT15, a loxP variant showing comparable recombination efficiency to wild-type loxP), and may be substituted and tested, e.g., in the methods and compositions described herein. Examples of attB and attP variants with suitable recombination efficiencies can be found, for example, in FIG. 3 of Groth et al. ( PNAS  97(11): 5995-6000, 2000), incorporated herein by reference. Certain recombination motifs may be preferable for use in in vitro recombination reactions, such as the bacteriophage lambda integrase, e.g., as described in Hartley et al. ( Genome Res.  10: 1788-1795, 2000), which is incorporated herein by reference. In further examples, the complementary site-specific recombination motif pairs attB1/attP1 and attB1/attP1 can be used in vectors of the present invention. In some instances, variants of recombination motifs may be capable of replacing the original recombination motif from which the variant was derived. In other instances, variants of recombination motifs may not be capable of replacing the original recombination motif. In particular instances, the variant recombination motifs may form distinct groups of complementary recombination motifs. For example, attB1 can recombine with attP1, but not with attP2.

     Scheme 5 describes a general synthetic method for the synthesis of chiral Î±-alkyl carboxylic acids that contain Î²-silyloxy ether protected acids 5.4 or ent-5.4. These optically active acids are used as the acid component in amide forming reaction (Step D of Scheme 1) to give Î²-tertiary alcohol amides. The diastereoselective bond construction via titanium enolate chemistry described by Evans was used to condense chiral imide 5.1 or ent-5.1 with a ketone or other electrophile to give diastereomerically pure aldol adducts 5.2 or ent-5.2, respectively (see Evans, D A, Urpi, F, Somers, T C, Clark, J S, Bilodeau, M T,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.  1990, 112, 8215-8216). The proper choice of chiral imide 5.1 will give rise to the desired absolute stereochemistry of the Î±-stereocenter in the carboxylic acids 5.4 or ent-5.4. Silyl ether protection of the aldol adducts 5.2 and ent-5.2 with tert-butyldimethylsilyltriflate and diisopropylethylamine gives the tert-butyldimethylsilyl ethers 5.3 and ent-5.3. Standard acyl oxazolidinone hydrolysis conditions using lithium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide in tetrahydrofuran and water provides the desired acids 5.4 or ent-5.4 (see Evans, D A, Britton, T C, Ellman, J A,  Tetrahedron Lett.  1987, 28(49), 6141-6144). Proper selection of ketones or other electrophiles in the titanium enolate chemistry will give rise to appropriately substituted aldol adducts that vary in the nature of the R 2  and R 3  groups. Changing the R 1  group of the starting imides 5.1 and ent-5.1 may be used to vary the size and nature of the R 1  group in the acids 5.4 or ent-5.4. This methodology allows one to synthesize ",0.95

The patent in question is titled 267 substituted purines as HDM2 inhibitors.  The extract of text citing that article is:  Dev., 7: (1993) p. 1126-1132; Barak et al., EMBO J, 12: (1993) p. 461-468]. However, in response to cellular DNA damage or under cellular stress, p53 activity increases helping to prevent the propagation of permanently damaged clones of cells by induction of cell cycle and growth arrest or apoptosis. 
     The regulation of p53 function relies on an appropriate balance between the two components of this p53-MDM2 auto-regulatory system. Indeed, this balance appears to be essential for cell survival. There are at least three ways that MDM2 acts to down-regulate p53 activity. First, MDM2 can bind to the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain of p53 to block expression of p53-responsive genes [Kussie et al., Science, 274: (1996) p. 948-953; Oliner et al., Nature, 362: (1993) p. 857-860; Momand et al, Cell, 69: (1992) p. 1237-1245]. Second, MDM2 shuttles p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm to facilitate the proteolytic degradation of p53 [Roth et al, EMBO J, 17: (1998) p. 554-564; Freedman et al., Mol Cell Biol, 18: (1998) p. 7288-7293; Tao and Levine, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 96: (1999) p. 3077-3080]. Finally, MDM2 possesses an intrinsic E3 ligase activity for conjugating ubiquitin to p53 for degradation within the ubiquitin-dependent 26S proteosome pathway [Honda et al., FEBS Lett, 420: (1997) p. 25-27; Yasuda, Oncogene 19: (2000) p. 1473-1476]. Thus, MDM2 impedes the ability of the p53 transcription factor to promote the expression of its target genes by binding p53 in the nucleus. Attenuating the p53-MDM2 auto-regulatory system can have a critical effect on cell homeostasis. Consistently, a correlation between the overexpression of MDM2 and tumor formation has been reported [Chene, Nature 3: (2003) p. 102-109]. Functional inactivation of wild type p53 is found in many types of human tumors. Restoring the function of p53 in tumor cells by anti-MDM2 therapy would result in slowing the tumor proliferation and instead stimulate apoptosis. Not surprisingly then, there is currently a substantial effort bei",0.38

     Mechanistic Analysis of DKK3b-Induced JNK Activation in Prostate Tumors 
     The JNK pathway is widely recognized as an important regulator of tumor biology and serves as a key cellular defense mechanism to prevent genetic instability and the development of aneuploidy. (Kennedy, et al. 2003  Cell Cycle  2(3):199-201; Vivanco, et al. 2007  Cancer Cell  11(6):555-569; Whitmarsh, et al. 2007 Oncogene 26(22):3172-3184; MacCorkle, et al. 2004  J Biol Chem  279(38):40112-40121; Miyamoto-Yamasaki, et al. 2007  Cell Biol Int.;  31(12):1501-1506; Nakaya, et al. 2009  Cell Biochem Funct  27(7):468-472; Wang, et al. 2009  J Pathol  218(1):95-103.) Previous reports have shown that DKK3 over-expression in tumor cells increases JNK activity leading to inhibition of cell proliferation and increased cell loss mediated, in part, by apoptosis. (Edamura, et al. 2007  Cancer Gene Ther  14(9):765-772; Abarzua, et al. 2005  Cancer Res  65(21):9617-9622; Ikezoe, et al. 2004  Br J Cancer  90(10):2017-2024; Kawano, et al. 2006  Oncogene  25(49):6528-6537.) 
     In our hands, DKK3b-dependent growth arrest in DU145 prostate tumor cell requires, in part, the JNK stress kinase pathway ( FIG. 5A ). While DKK3b halted cell proliferation, TAT-JBD inhibition of JNK activity blocked cell loss ( FIG. 5A ), suggesting that the JNK pathway is required for cell loss. These results agree with our observations that Jnk inhibits prostate tumor formation in the well-established conditional Pten mouse model of prostate canc",0.98

The extract of text citing that article is: tide primer annealing, and primer extension by thermophilic template dependent polynucleotide polymerase, resulting in the exponential increase in copies of the desired sequence of the polynucleotide analyte flanked by the primers. The two different PCR primers, which anneal to opposite strands of the DNA, are positioned so that the polymerase catalyzed extension product of one primer can serve as a template strand for the other, leading to the accumulation of a discrete double stranded fragment whose length is defined by the distance between the 5â€² ends of the oligonucleotide primers. 
     LCR uses a ligase enzyme to join pairs of preformed nucleic acid probes. The probes hybridize with each complementary strand of the nucleic acid analyte, if present, and ligase is employed to bind each pair of probes together resulting in two templates that can serve in the next cycle to reiterate the particular nucleic acid sequence. 
     SDA (Westin et a 2000, Nature Biotechnology, 18, 199-202; Walker et al 1992, Nucleic Acids Research, 20, 7, 1691-1696), is an isothermal amplification technique based upon the ability of a restriction endonuclease such as HincII or BsoBI to nick the unmodified strand of a hemiphosphorothioate form of its recognition site, and the ability of an exonuclease deficient DNA polymerase such as Klenow exo minus polymerase, or Bst polymerase, to extend the 3â€²-end at the nick and displace the downstream DNA strand.

     III. Traits for Modification and Improvement of Soybean Varieties 
     In certain embodiments, a soybean plant provided by the invention may comprise one or more transgene(s). One example of such a transgene confers herbicide resistance. Common herbicide resistance genes include an EPSPS gene conferring glyphosate resistance, a neomycin phosphotransferase II (nptII) gene conferring resistance to kanamycin (Fraley et al., 1983), a hygromycin phosphotransferase gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic hygromycin (Vanden Elzen et al., 1985), genes conferring resistance to glufosinate or broxynil (Comai et al., 1985; Gordon-Kamm et al., 1990; Stalker et al., 1988) such as dihydrofolate reductase and acetolactate synthase (Eichholtz et al., 1987, Shah et al., 1986, Charest et al., 1990). Further examples include mutant ALS and AHAS enzymes conferring resistance to imidazalinone or a sulfonylurea (Lee et al., 1988; Mild et al., 1990), a phosphinothricin-acetyl-transferase gene conferring phosphinothricin resistance (European Appln. 0 242 246), genes conferring resistance to phenoxy proprionic acids and cycloshexones, such as sethoxydim and haloxyfop (Marshall et al., 1992); and genes conferring resistance to triazine (psbA and gs+ genes) and benzonitrile (nitrilase gene) (Przibila et al., 1991). 
     A plant of the invention may also comprise a gene that confers resistance to insect, pest, viral or bacterial attack. For example, a gene conferring resistance to a pest, such as soybean cyst nematode was described in PCT Application WO96/30517 and PCT Application WO93/19181. Jones et al., (1994) describe cloning of the tomato Cf-9 gene for resistance to  Cladosporium fulvum ); Martin et al., (1993) describe a tomato Pto gene for resistance to  Pseudomonas syringae  pv. and Mindrinos et al., (1994) describe an  Arabidopsis  RSP2 gene for resistance to  Pseudomonas syringae.

The patent in question is titled System and method for diagnosis and treatment.  The extract of text citing that article is: e. PARP catalyzes the formation of mono- and poly (ADP-ribose) polymers which can attach to cellular proteins (as well as to itself) and thereby modify the activities of those proteins. The enzyme plays a role in regulation of transcription, cell proliferation, and chromatin remodeling (see D&#39;amours et al., Biochem., 342: 249268, 1999). 
     Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase has an essential role in facilitating DNA repair, controlling RNA transcription, mediating cell death, and regulating immune response. These actions make PARP inhibitors targets for a broad spectrum of disorders. (Virag L., et al., Pharmacol. Rev. 2002 54(3):375-429). In various preclinical cancer models and human clinical trials, PARP inhibitors have been shown to potentiate radiation and chemotherapy by increasing apoptosis of cancer cells, limiting tumor growth, decreasing metastasis, and prolonging the survival of tumor-bearing subjects. (WO 2007-084532; Donawho C. K., et al., Clin Cancer Res 2007 13(9):2728-37; Kummar S, et al., J Clin Oncol. 2009 27(16):2705-11). 
     PARP comprises an N-terminal DNA binding domain, an automodification domain, and a C-terminal catalytic domain Various cellular proteins interact with PARP. The N-terminal DNA binding domain contains two zinc finger motifs. Transcription enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1), retinoid X receptor Î±, DNA polymerase Î±, X-ray repair cross-complementing factor-1 (XRCC1) and PARP itself interact with PARP in this domain. The automodification domain contains a BRCT motif, one of the protein-protein interaction modules. This motif is originally found in the C-terminus of BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility protein 1) and is present in various proteins related to DNA repair, recombination and cell-cycle checkpoint control. POU-homeodomain-containing octamer transcription factor-1 (Oct-1), YinYang (YY)1, and ubiquitinconjugating enzyme 9 (ubc9) could interact with this BRCT motif in PARP.

     As no anti-fouling surfaces are free from surface defects, fouling-mediated risk for bacterial adhesion and infection still necessitates the design of surface coatings that are also bactericidal. Most common practice in affording implants with bactericidal properties is by non-covalently encapsulating and release antibiotics near the implant. (Li, et al. 2010  J of Controlled Release  145, 221-230; Hanssen, et al. 2004  Clin Orthop Relat Res  427, 79-85.) Such a local delivery strategy, however, often suffers from sub-optimal drug release kinetics and associated side effects (e.g. burst release could lead to significant systemic toxicity and the quick depletion of local drug concentration while too slow of a release comprises short-term bactericidal efficiency). (Anderson, et al. 2009  Biomaterials  30, 5675-5681; Penner, et al. 1996  J of arthroplasty  11, 939-944.) An alternative strategy recently being pursued is to covalently tether antibiotics on the implant surface, which typically involves binding small molecule linkers to surface metal oxides followed by conjugation of the drug using conventional esterification/amidation chemistry. (Antoci, et al. 2008  Biomaterials  29, 4684-4690; Antoci, et al. 2007  Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,  81-87; Edupuganti, et al. 2007  Bioorganic  &amp;  Medicinal Chemistry Letters  17, 2692-2696; Jose, et al. 2005  Chemistry  &amp;  Biology  12, 1041-1048; Antoci, et al. 2007  Journal of Orthopaedic Research  25, 858-866.)

In addition, such surface coatings do not prevent the attachment of killed bacteria or the built up of biofilms since they are not anti-fouling in nature. Indeed, although implants covalen",0.68

The patent in question is titled Use of beta-adrenergic inverse agonists for smoking cessation.  The extract of text citing that article is: ells, and serous and mucous cells located in submucosal glands. The cilia are surrounded by an aqueous layer (periciliary fluid) secreted into the lumen of the airway passage by the active transport of chloride and the passive movement of water across the epithelium. The cilia make contact with the mucus floating on this aqueous layer, and via a unidirectional propelling motion provide for movement of mucus toward the glottis (see Pierson and Kacmarek, supra and Fauci et al., supra). Mucus is produced by the epithelial goblet cells and submucosal gland cells and is secreted into the lumen of the airway after degranulation. 
     Mucus is characterized by the presence of a family of glycoproteins known generally as mucins. Mucins are a family of glycoproteins secreted by the epithelial cells including those at the respiratory, gastrointestinal and female reproductive tracts. Mucins are responsible for the viscoelastic properties of mucus and at least eight mucin genes are known. (D. J. Thornton, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272, 9561-9566 (1997)). Analysis of airway secretions has identified MUC5AC and MUC5B as the primary mucin constituents of the respiratory mucus gel. 
     While mucus generally facilitates the clearance of inhaled particles or infectious agents, hypersecretion of mucus in the airways may cause progressive airway obstruction. In peripheral airways, cough is ineffective for clearing secretions. Furthermore, because of their small dimensions, small airways containing many goblet cells are especially vulnerable to airway plugging by mucus. Airway hypersecretion affects a substantial number of individuals; it is seen in a variety of pulmonary diseases, such as chronic bronchitis, acute asthma, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis. Also, other conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis and tuberculosis are also characterized by mucus hypersecretion. As indicated above, mucous hypersecretion is a significant symptom in cigarette smokers and smokers attempting smoking cessation, and is frequently responsible for failu",0.32

Capillaries have a diameter of approximately 5 Î¼m so that only nanoparticles are administered intravenously. Microparticles are typically around 100 Î¼m in diameter and are administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. See, for example, Kreuter, J.,  Colloidal Drug Delivery Systems , J.

     Polymers can be used for ion-controlled release of the antibody compositions disclosed herein. Various degradable and nondegradable polymeric matrices for use in controlled drug delivery are known in the art (Langer,  Accounts Chem. Res.  26:537-542, 1993). For example, the block copolymer, polaxamer 407, exists as a viscous yet mobile liquid at low temperatures but forms a semisolid gel at body temperature. It has been shown to be an effective vehicle for formulation and sustained delivery of recombinant interleukin-2 and urease (Johnston et al.,  Pharm. Res.  9:425-434, 1992; and Pec et al.,  J.

The patent in question is titled Conductive transition metal oxide nanostructured electrochromic material and optical switching devices constructed thereof.  The extract of text citing that article is: #39;s equation predicts a stronger dependence of the peak wavelength on RI than was observed experimentally. This difference can be ascribed to the non-spherical shape of the particles as well as the contribution of the ligands attached to the surface of the nanocrystals. 
     The connection between SPR and particle shape has been well studied for metal nanoparticles. For example, a wide range of gold nanoparticle shapes have been studied, including stars, dumbbells, and triangular and hexagonal plates. The influence of shape on SPR has also been studied in silver octahedra, rods, triangles, and plates. Recently, the possibility for doped semiconductor nanocrystals to exhibit shape-dependent plasmonic properties has been investigated. Results for vacancy-doped copper chalcogenide nanocrystals are conflicting. Cu 2-x S is known to have tunable plasmons, and changing the aspect ratio of semiconductor Cu 2-x S nanodiscs has a strong influence on the NIR spectrum absorption. By contrast, Kriegel et. al. found that the SPR of Cu 2-x Te nanospheres, rods, and tetrapods have only a weak shape dependence (see L. Kriegel et al.,  ACS Nano  2013, 7, 4367-4377). 
     Changing the aspect ratio of phosphorous-doped silicon nanowires was also reported to yield a shape-dependent SPR. In the case of substitutionally-doped metal oxides, Gordon et. al. have recently published clear evidence of shape dependent SPR in indium-doped cadmium oxide spheres and octahedral (see T. R. Gordon et al.,  Nano Lett.  2013, 13, 2857-2863).

Chem C.,  2007, 111, 3806-3819). That is, truncating a cube results in shapes with different numbers of planes or faces; cube (6 faces), truncated cube (14 faces), icosohedron (20 faces), and sphere (infinite faces). As the number of faces on the particle increases, three important trends are apparent in the resonance spectra. First, the main/largest resonance will blue-shift.

     Mutations that Reduce Signaling in FOXP3 âˆ’  T Cells but Stimulate STAT5 Signaling in T-Reg 
     The IL-2 variants were screened for their ability to stimulate AKT and STAT5 phosphorylation in T cell subsets. Several IL-2 variants were as potent, or nearly as potent, as wt IL-2 at stimulating STAT5 in FOXP3 +  T cells 10 min after stimulation. Three hours after washing IL-2 from the media, some IL-2 variants (haD, haD.1, haD.2, haD.4, haD.6, and haD.8) continued to stimulate sustained STAT5 signaling at levels higher than that seen with wt IL-2. In contrast, for FOXP3 âˆ’  T cells, STAT5 and AKT responses to the haD variants after 10 min stimulation were not nearly as high as those stimulated by wt IL-2 or haWT. After 3 hrs, weak STAT5 and AKT signals similar to those seen with wt IL-2 were observed in T-eff, however, at this late timepoint wt IL-2 signaling had diminished greatly. In FOXP3 +  T cells, AKT signaling is not normally stimulated by IL-2 (Zeiser R, et al, 2008  Blood  111:453) thus the phospho-AKT signal observed in total T cell lysates can be attributed to T-eff. 
     Methods: Previously activated (with anti-CD3 for 2-3 days) and rested (in fresh culture medium for 2-5 days) T cells were exposed to 1 nM wt or mutant IL-2 for 10 min at 37Â° C. Cells were then stained (10 min timepoint) or washed and cultured for an additional 3 hrs (3 hr timepoint). To measure phospho-AKT by ELISA, a 50 Î¼l culture was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2Ã— lysis buffer and lysates were measured for phospho-AKT with multiplex ELISA plates according to the manufacturer&#39;s protocols (MesoScale Discovery, Gaithersburg, Md.). To measure phospho-STAT5 by flow cytometry, a 50 Î¼l culture was stopped by adding 1 ml of FOXP3 Fix/Perm Buffer (BioLegend, San Diego, Calif.), incubation at 25Â° C. for 20 min, and staining for cell surface markers, FOXP3 and phospho-STAT5 according the BioLegend FOXP3 staining protocol.",0.82

The extract of text citing that article is:  can be used to separate and isolate the desired stem cells using fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS), panning methods, magnetic particle selection, particle sorter selection and other methods known to persons skilled in the art, including density separation (Xu et al. (2002) Circ. Res. 91:501; U.S.S.N. 20030022367) and separation based on other physical properties (Doevendans et al. (2000) J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 32:839-851). 
     Alternatively, genetic selection methods can be used, where a progenitor or stem cell can be genetically engineered to express a reporter protein operatively linked to a tissue-specific promoter and/or a specific gene promoter; therefore the expression of the reporter can be used for positive selection methods to isolate and enrich the desired stem cell. For example, a fluorescent reporter protein can be expressed in the desired stem cell by genetic engineering methods to operatively link the marker protein to a promoter active in a desired stem cell (Klug et al. (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 98:216-224; U.S. Pat. No. 6,737,054). In some embodiments, cells from which the human lung progenitor cells are derived are not modified using genetic means. Other approaches for positive selection include drug selection, for instance as described by Klug et al., supra, involving enrichment of desired cells by density gradient centrifugation. Negative selection can be performed, selecting and removing cells with undesired markers or characteristics, for example fibroblast markers, epithelial cell markers etc. 
     Undifferentiated ES cells express genes that can be used as markers to detect the presence of undifferentiated cells.

The patient has no other identified mutations and his phenotype is consistent with p110Î´ deficiency in mice as far as studied. (Jou et al. Int. J. Immunogenet. 33: 361-369 (2006)). 
     Isoform-selective small molecule compounds have been developed with varying success to all Class I PI3 kinase isoforms (Ito et al. J. Pharm. Exp. Therapeut., 321:1-8 (2007)). Inhibitors to alpha are desirable because mutations in p110Î± have been identified in several solid tumors; for example, an amplification mutation of alpha is associated with 50% of ovarian, cervical, lung and breast cancer and an activation mutation has been described in more than 50% of bowel and 25% of breast cancers (Hennessy et al. Nature Reviews, 4: 988-1004 (2005)). Yamanouchi has developed a compound YM-024 that inhibits alpha and delta equipotently and is 8- and 28-fold selective over beta and gamma respectively (Ito et al.

     The present invention relates generally to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) enzymes, and more particularly to selective inhibitors of PI3K activity and to methods of using such materials. 
     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     Cell signaling via 3â€²-phosphorylated phosphoinositides has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, e.g., malignant transformation, growth factor signaling, inflammation, and immunity (see Rameh et al., J. Biol Chem, 274:8347-8350 (1999) for a review). The enzyme responsible for generating these phosphorylated signaling products, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase; PI3K), was originally identified as an activity associated with viral oncoproteins and growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its phosphorylated derivatives at the 3â€²-hydroxyl of the inositol ring (Panayotou et al., Trends Cell Biol 2:358-60 (1992)). 
     The levels of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), the primary product of PI 3-kinase activation, increase upon treatment of cells with a variety of stimuli. This includes signaling through receptors for the majority of growth factors and many inflammatory stimuli, hormones, neurotransmitters and antigens, and thus the activation of PI3Ks represents one, if not the most prevalent, signal transduction events associated with mammalian cell surface receptor activation (Cantley, Science 296:1655-1657 (2002); Vanhaesebroeck et al. Annu. Rev",0.0

The patent in question is titled Combination therapy with an anti-hyaluronan agent and therapeutic agent.  The extract of text citing that article is: lude, for example, pancreatic tumors, ovarian tumors, lung tumors, colon tumors, prostate tumors, cervical tumors and breast tumors. 
     In particular, the cancers can be hyaluronan-rich cancers that are suited for targeting by an anti-hyaluronan agent, such as a hyaluronan-degrading enzyme. Several hyaluronan-rich cancers have been identified. Hyaluronan-rich tumors include, but are not limited to, prostate, breast, colon, ovarian, stomach, head and neck and other tumors and cancers. In some cases, hyaluronan levels correlate with poor prognosis, for example, decreased survival rate and/or recurrence-free survival rate, metastases, angiogenesis, cancer cell invasion into other tissues/areas, and other indicators of poor prognosis. Such correlation has been observed, for example, in hyaluronan-rich tumors including ovarian cancer, SCC, ISC, prostate cancer, lung cancer, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, colon cancer and pancreatic cancer (see, for example, Anttila et al., (2000)  Cancer Research,  60:150-155; Karvinen et al., (2003)  British Journal of Dermatology,  148:86-94; Lipponen et al., (2001)  Eur. Journal of Cancer,  849-856; Pirinen et al., (2001)  Int. J. Cancer:  95: 12-17; Auvinen et al., (2000)  American Journal of Pathology,  156(2):529-536; Ropponen et al., (1998)  Cancer Research,  58: 342-347). Thus, hyaluronan-rich cancers can be treated by administration of an anti-hyaluronan agent, such as a hyaluronidase, to treat one or more symptoms of the cancer. 
     In examples of treating hyaluronan-rich cancers, the anti-hyaluronan agent, such as a hyaluronan-degrading enzyme, can act as a therapeutic by itself and/or it can enhance the activity of other co-administered or combination therapies. For example, hyaluronan-degrading enzymes, such as hyaluronidase, have direct anticarcinogenic effects when injected into tumors. Hyaluronidase prevents growth of tumors transplanted into mice (De Maeyer et al., (1992)  Int. J. Cancer  51:657-660) and inhibits tumor formation upon exposure to carcinogens (Pawlowski et al. (1979) Int.  J. Cancer  23:105-109) Hyaluronidase is effective as the sole therapeutic agent in the treatment of brain cancer (gliomas) (see, International Pat. Pub",0.98

Furthermore, the integrational elements may be non-encoding or encoding polynucleotides. On the other hand, the vector may be integrated into the genome of the host cell by non-homologous recombination. 
     For autonomous replication, the vector may further comprise an origin of replication enabling the vector to replicate autonomously in the host cell in question. The origin of replication may be any plasmid replicator mediating autonomous replication that functions in a cell. The term â€œorigin of replicationâ€ or â€œplasmid replicatorâ€ means a polynucleotide that enables a plasmid or vector to replicate in vivo. 
     Examples of origins of replication for use in a yeast host cell are the 2 micron origin of replication, ARS1, ARS4, the combination of ARS1 and CEN3, and the combination of ARS4 and CEN6. 
     Examples of origins of replication useful in a filamentous fungal cell are AMA1 and ANS1 (Gems et al., 1991 , Gene  98: 61-67; Cullen et al., 1987 , Nucleic Acids Res.  15: 9163-9175; WO 00/24883). Isolation of the AMA1 gene and construction of plasmids or vectors comprising the gene can be accomplished according to the methods disclosed in WO 00/24883. 
     More than one copy of a polynucleotide may be inserted into a host cell to increase production of a polypeptide.

The patent in question is titled Broad spectrum conjugate vaccine to prevent Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.  The extract of text citing that article is: ent pathogens associated with wound infections in combat personnel. They can cause serious clinical syndromes including abscess formation, cellulitis, disseminated infection, and bacteremia leading to progressive amputation, permanent impairment and death by septic shock. The growing proportion of  Klebsiella pneumoniae  and PA that are multi-drug resistant (MDR) complicates treatment Immunoprophylactic measures against PA and  Klebsiella pneumoniae  can be effective irrespective of the antibiotic resistance phenotypes. 
       Klebsiella pneumoniae  can express two virulence-associated polysaccharides (PS): a secreted cell-associated capsular polysaccharide (CPS) that coats the bacterium and a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that forms the outer leaflet of the outer-membrane. The polysaccharide portion of  Klebsiella pneumoniae  LPS is comprised of a genus-specific conserved core and a serotype specific polymer of O polysaccharide (OPS;  FIG. 1 ) for which there are Ëœ9 recognized serotypes (Vinogradov E,  J Biol Chem.  2002; 277(28):25070-25081; Vinogradov E, Carbohydr Res. 2001; 335(4):291-296). 
     Importantly, the prevalence of OPS types among clinical isolates is highly restricted. Hospital based surveys of invasive infections have revealed that four OPS serotypes (O1, O2a, O3 and O5) account for 60-80% strains causing infections in the USA and worldwide. By comparison, there are at least 80 identified CPS serotypes of which greater than 25 are associated with invasive infections in humans in the USA (Podschun R,  Clin Microbiol Rev.  1998; 11(4):589-603; Hansen D S,  J Clin Microbiol.  1999; 37(1):56-62); Trautmann M,  Vaccine.  2004; 22(7):818-821; Cryz S J, Jr.,  J Clin Microbiol.  1986; 23(4):687-690). Furthermore, the incidence and prevalence of invasive infections attributed to various CPS serotypes varies dramatically worldwide; CPS types that are prevalent in one region, can be absent entirely in others (Cryz S J, Jr.,  J Clin Microbiol.  1986; 23(4):687-690), including potential areas of m",0.97

     Optimization of Nanofiber Configuration (Surface Functionality and Alignment) 
     Axonal growth cones are guided to their targets by contact-guidance mechanism or by diffusible chemotropic factors. The adhesion guidance function of the nanofibers can be improved by surface conjugating relevant adhesion molecules. We have demonstrated that the adhesion property of nanofibers can be dramatically improved by surface functionalization (Jiang et al., 2006; Fischer et al., 2007). Laminin (LN) has been identified as an effective matrix molecule that mediates the adhesion and migration of axons and Schwann cells. Of particular interest to this study is a set of LN-coated PCL or PCLEEP nanofibers showing effective support for neural stem cell adhesion and alignment along the axis of the nanofibers ( FIG. 5 ) (Chua et al., 2007). This alignment promotes the neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells (NSC",0.96

The patent in question is titled Dimeric bacteriophage lysins.  The extract of text citing that article is:  acid positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same nucleotide or amino acid as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % identity=# of identical positions/total # of positions.times.100). 
     The determination of percent identity between two sequences may be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. A preferred, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:5873-5877 (1993). Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST program which may be used to identify sequences having the desired identity to nucleotide sequences of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST may be utilized as described in Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 25:3389-3402 (1997). When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., NBLAST) may be used. See the programs provided by National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health. In one embodiment, parameters for sequence comparison may be set at W=12. Parameters may also be varied (e.g., W=5 or W=20).

The patent in question is titled Modified proteins and methods of making and using same.  The extract of text citing that article is: odifications located at any position other than the invariant residues. 
     The A and C motifs are part of the palm domain, and each contains a strictly conserved aspartic acid residue, which are involved in the catalytic mechanism common to all the DNA polymerases. DNA synthesis is mediated by transfer of a phosphoryl group from the incoming nucleotide to the 3â€² OH of the DNA, releasing a polyphosphate moiety and forming a new DNA phosphodiester bond. This reaction is catalyzed by a mechanism involving two metal ions, normally Mg 2+ , and the two conserved aspartic acid residues. 
     The conserved glutamic acid residue in motif A of the A family DNA polymerases plays an important role in incorporation of the correct nucleotide, as does the corresponding conserved tyrosine in B family members (Minnick et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 99: 1194-1199 (2002); Parsell et al, Nucleic Acids Res. 35: 3076-3086 (2002). Mutations at the conserved Leu of motif A affect replication fidelity (Venkatesan et al., J. Biol. Chem. 281: 4486-4494 (2006)). 
     The B motif contains conserved lysine, tyrosine and glycine residues. The B motif of  E coli  pol I has been shown to bind nucleotide substrates and contains a conserved tyrosine which has been shown to be in the active site. 
     The B family polymerases contain six conserved motifs, of which regions I and II correspond to the A and C motifs of the A family. Region III is involved in nucleotide binding and is functionally homologous to motif B. Regions I, II and III converge at the center of the active site from the palm (I), the fingers (II), and base of the thumb (III) to produce a contiguous conserved surface. Within these regions, a set of highly conserved residues form three chemically distinct clusters consisting of exposed aromatic residues (Y416, Y567, and Y391), negatively charged residues (D621, D623, D411, D684, and E686), and a positively charged cluster (K560, R482, and K486).

The extract of text citing that article is: her mononuclear cells) or molecules (e.g., pro-inflammatory cytokines) associated with inflammation. 
     RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and/or PI3K/AKT/PTEN/mTOR pathways are known to be deregulated in various cancers due to specific mutations in different members of each pathway. For example, in RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, RAS protein is mutated frequently at residues 12, 13 and 61 (see, e.g., Prio et al, Cancer Research (2012) 72(10): 2457-2467) while B-RAF is mutated only at amino acid position 600. The RAS gene mutations are easily detected in tumor samples using the methods known in the art such as described by Sarkar et al (Diagn Mol Pathol. (1995) 4(4):266-73), while B-RAF mutations can be detected with an FDA approved kit available from Roche (CobasÂ® 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test). In the PI3K/AKT/PTEN/mTOR pathway, PI3K-alpha isozyme, PTEN and less frequently AKT are mutated in a wide variety of solid tumors. The PI3K-alpha subunit is commonly mutated at residues 542, 545 and 1047 (see, e.g., Karakas et al, British J. Cancer (2006), 94:455-459). Similarly, mutations have been identified in PTEN tumor suppressor gene in a broad range of solid tumors. Most of the PTEN mutations render loss of PTEN activity through either frame-shift or non-sense mutations. About 3% of breast cancer tumors exhibit mutations in AKT protein at position 17 (Yi et al, Oncotarget (2013) 4(1), 29-34). 
     Identifying a mammalian subject, e.g., a human patient, who will respond positively to treatment with compounds of the invention prior to initiation of treatment (also termed herein â€œpredetermining or selectingâ€) can be accomplished by assaying a sample from a cancer patient to detect one or more of the RAS, B-RAF, PI3K-Î± isozyme (or another selected PI3K isozyme or combinations thereof as described herein), PTEN or AKT mutations discussed above.

     It is believed that use of the phosphorus-containing initiator produces polymers by anionic polymerization techniques or mechanisms. The key mechanistic features of anionic polymerization have been described in books (e.g., Hsieh, H. L.; Quirk, R. P. Anionic Polymerization: Principles and Practical Applications; Marcel Dekker: New York, 1996) and review articles (e.g., Hadjichristidis, N.; Pitsikalis, M.; Pispas, S.; Iatrou, H.; Chem. Rev. 2001, 101(12), 3747-3792). These initiators may advantageously produce living polymers that, prior to quenching, are capable of reacting with additional monomers for further chain growth or reacting with certain coupling and/or functionalizing agents to give coupled or terminal-functionalized polymers. As those skilled in the art appreciate, these reactive polymers include a reactive chain end, which is believed to be ionic, at which a reaction between a functionalizing and/or coupling agent and the polymer takes place. 
     Anionic polymerization may be conducted in polar solvents, non-polar solvents, and mixtures thereof. In one or more embodiments, a solvent may be employed as a carrier to either dissolve or suspend the initiator in order to facilitate the delivery of the initiator to the polymerization system. Solvents useful for conducting the polymerizations include those solvents mentioned above that are useful in preparing the initiator solutions. In particular embodiments, alkane",0.41

Moreover, inhibition of MALT1 paracaspase leads to ABC-DLBCL cell death and growth retardation. 
     MALT lymphoma is a cancer of the B-cell lymphocytes. It usually affects older people who are in their 60s. Most Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHLs) start in the lymph nodes, but MALT lymphoma starts in a type of lymphatic tissue called mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). The stomach is the most common area for MALT lymphoma to develop in, but it may also start in other organs such as the lung, thyroid, salivary gland or bowel. MALT lymphomas may start in areas of the body where there has been an infection or when the person has an autoimmune condition affecting that area. Because MALT lymphoma develops outside the lymph nodes, it&#39;s also known as extranodal lymphoma. Gastric MALT lymphoma is frequently associated (72-98%) with chronic inflammation as a result of the presence of  Helicobacter pylori  (Parsonnet J. (1994).  New Engl. J. Med.  330 (18): 1267-71). The initial diagnosis is made by biopsy of suspicious lesions on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD, upper endoscopy). Simultaneous tests for  H. pylori  are also done to detect the presence of this microbe. In other sites, chronic immune stimulation is also suspected in the pathogenesis (e.g. association between chronic autoimmune diseases such as SjÃ¶gren&#39;s syndrome and Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis, and MALT lymphoma of the salivary gland and the thyroid). In MALT lymphoma the frequent translocation t(11;18)(q21;q21) creates a fusion between the C-terminus of MALT1 including the paracaspase domain and the N-terminus of IAP2. The paracaspase domain of IAP2-MALT1 fusion protein catalyzes the cleavage of NIK and thereby enhances non-canonical NF-ÎºB activation, which confers apoptosis resistance (Rosebeck et al.,  Science  2011, 331, 468-472; Isaacson and Du,  Nat. Rev. Cancer  2004, 4, 644-53). Two further translocations have been identified: t(",0.21

     Moreover, anti-Kallidin or des-Arg10-Kallidin antibodies of the invention can be fused to marker sequences, such as a peptide to facilitate their purification or detection. In preferred embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide (SEQ ID NO: 137), such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259 Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, Calif., 91311), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:821-824 (1989), for instance, hexa-histidine (SEQ ID NO: 137) provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include, but are not limited to, the â€œHAâ€ tag, which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein (Wilson et al., Cell 37:767 (1984)) and the â€œflagâ€ tag. 
     Anti-Kallidin or des-Arg10-Kallidin antibodies of the invention may be used in non-conjugated form or may be conjugated to at least one of a variety of molecules, e.g., to improve the therapeutic properties of the molecule, to facilitate target detection, or for imaging or therapy of the patient.

The extract of text citing that article is: the EGF receptor. They bind less tightly to the other receptors in the EGF receptor family. Neu differentiation factors (NDFs)/heregulins are ligands for EbrB-3 and ErbB-4. (Beerli, R. R., 1996 , J. Biol. Chem.  271:6071-6076. Carraway, K. L. et al., 1994 , J. Biol. Chem.  269:14303-14306. Plowman, G. D., et al., 1993 , Nature  366:473-475.) 
     Thus, EGF, TGFÎ±, amphiregulin, HB-EGF, BTC, and NDFs are also polypeptides that may be in fusion proteins with SEQ ID NO:1. 
     The sequence of a precursor of EGF is SEQ ID NO:9. In mature EGF, the amino terminal methionine of SEQ ID NO:9 is removed. (Gregory, H., 1975 , Nature  257:325-327.) The sequence of the precursor of TGFÎ± is SEQ ID NO:10. Mature TGFÎ± is thought to be residues 40-89 of SEQ ID NO:10. (Qian, J. F., et al., 1993 , Gene  132:291-296.

The software also can include code indicating which the test sample is closest to, thereby providing a probable diagnosis. 
     Production of Antibodies to Detect Neural Biomarkers 
     Neural biomarkers obtained from samples in patients suffering from varying neural injuries, degrees of severity of injury, neuronal disorders and the like, can be prepared as described above. Furthermore, neural biomarkers can be subjected to enzymatic digestion to obtain fragments or peptides of the biomarkers for the production of antibodies to different antigenic epitopes that can be present in a peptide versus the whole protein. Antigenic epitopes are useful, for example, to raise antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies, that specifically bind the epitope. Antigenic epitopes can be used as the target molecules in immunoassays. (See, for instance, Wilson et al.,  Cell  37:767-778 (1984); Sutcliffe et al.,  Science  219:660-666 (1983)).

     Polysialylation: The present disclosure also contemplates the use of polysialylation, the conjugation of peptides and proteins to the naturally occurring, biodegradable Î±-(2â†’8) linked polysialic acid (â€œPSAâ€) in order to improve their stability and in vivo pharmacokinetics. PSA is a biodegradable, non-toxic natural polymer that is highly hydrophilic, giving it a high apparent molecular weight in the blood which increases its serum half-life. In addition, polysialylation of a range of peptide and protein therapeutics has led to markedly reduced proteolysis, retention of in vivo activity, and reduction in immunogenicity and antigenicity (see, e.g., G. Gregoriadis et al., Int. J. Pharmaceutics 300(1-2):125-30). As with modifications with other conjugates (e.g., PEG), various techniques for site-specific polysialylation are available (see, e.g., T. Lindhout et al., PNAS 108(18)7397-7402 (2011)). 
     Fusion Proteins. The present disclosure contemplates fusion proteins of wild type mature GDF15 (e.g., human GDF15), as well as fusion proteins of the Polypeptides of the present disclosure (e.g., modified human GDF15 molecules, muteins of human GDF15, modified GDF15 muteins, and the like). Such fusion proteins are generally comprised of a non-GDF15 polypeptide (e.g., albumin (e.g., HSA) or a fragment thereof: albumin binding domain (ABD); Fc polypeptide; maltose binding domain (MBD), which may be referred to herein as a â€œfusion partnerâ€, conjugated to the wild type GDF15 polypeptide or Polypeptide of the present disclosure at its N-terminus or C-terminus. Optionally, the fusion partner may be conjugated to the wild type GDF15 or Polypeptide through a linker polypeptide.

The patent in question is titled Selectively disrupted whole-cell vaccine.  The extract of text citing that article is: ranscutaneous immunization route was tested by application of cotton gauze patches containing antigen and LT adjuvant to the dorsal skin lightly abraded to disrupt the stratum corneum as done previously for other vaccine preparations. Zhu et al., 15 Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 359 (2008). Experience with other systems commended reduction of particle size, so fragments with mean diameters of 100 nm (WCC100) and 20 nm (WCC20) were tested. WCC100 and WCC20 were similarly protective when applied with LT, in comparison with LT or with WCC100 applied alone. Consistent with the protection, priming for IL-17A responses in vitro greatly exceeded levels associated with protection by i.n. immunization ( FIG. 12C ). See also Lu et al., 2008. Transdermal vaccination thus is another alternative to the intranasal route.

In the superior retina of the dog, backscatter from the tapetum forms the highest intensity peak, and RPE and IS/OS peaks are located vitreal to the tapetal peak. ONL thickness was defined from the sclerad transition of the OPL to the OLM, and ONL thickness topography was calculated. In addition, the topography of IS/OS backscatter intensity was calculated by first measuring the mean backscatter intensity within Â±8 Î¼m of the IS/OS peak and then normalizing this value by the mean backscatter intensity of the first 75 Î¼m of retina sclerad to the retina-vitreous interface. For all topographic results, locations of blood vessels, optic nerve head and bleb boundaries were overlaid for reference. Further quantitative comparisons were achieved by sampling the ONL thickness of a 10Â° wide band along the vertical meridian crossing the optic nerve head.

The patent in question is titled Phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors with a zinc binding moiety.  The extract of text citing that article is: uch as cancer. The compounds of the present invention may further act as HDAC or matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors by virtue of their ability to bind zinc ions. Surprisingly these compounds are active at multiple therapeutic targets and are effective for treating disease. Moreover, in some cases it has even more surprisingly been found that the compounds have enhanced activity when compared to the activities of combinations of separate molecules individually having the PI3-Kinase and HDAC activity. In other words, the combination of PI3-kinases and HDAC inhibitors into a single molecule may provide a synergistic effect as compared to the PI3-kinases. In another embodiment, certain compounds of the present invention also inhibit mTor in addition to having PI3-Kinase and HDAC activity. 
     Moreover, the efficacy of single-agent PI3K pathway inhibitors is limited by the presence of primary/acquired genetic alterations and activation of multiple pro-survival and growth pathways (Engelman (2009) Nature Reviews Cancer, 9: 550-562) Inhibition of PI3K by single-agent PI3K pathway inhibitors can actually upregulate signaling of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway by the release of negative feedback loops. The compounds of the invention, by virtue of their integrated PI3K/HDAC inhibitory activities, provide the potential to overcome the limitations in the treatment of cancers with single-target PI3K inhibitors. The compounds of the invention may disrupt cancer networks in in vivo and in vitro experiments, resulting from durable inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, the inhibition of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, and the downregulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) protein levels.

The patent in question is titled Products comprising an extracellular matrix tissue material and osteogenic protein.  The extract of text citing that article is: taining. Such non-collagenous solids can constitute a significant percentage of the dry weight of the ECM material in certain inventive embodiments, for example at least about 1%, at least about 3%, and at least about 5% by weight in various embodiments of the invention. 
     The submucosa-containing or other ECM tissue material used in the present invention may also exhibit an angiogenic character and thus be effective to induce angiogenesis in a host engrafted with the material. In this regard, angiogenesis is the process through which the body makes new blood vessels to generate increased blood supply to tissues. Thus, angiogenic materials, when contacted with host tissues, promote or encourage the formation of new blood vessels into the materials. Methods for measuring in vivo angiogenesis in response to biomaterial implantation have recently been developed. For example, one such method uses a subcutaneous implant model to determine the angiogenic character of a material. See, C. Heeschen et al., Nature Medicine 7 (2001), No. 7, 833-839. When combined with a fluorescence microangiography technique, this model can provide both quantitative and qualitative measures of angiogenesis into biomaterials. C.

     Decellularized ECM tissue layers can be used in the invention as single layer implants, but in certain embodiments will be used in multilaminate constructs. In this regard, a variety of techniques for laminating layers together are known and can be used to prepare multilaminate constructs used for the graft in the present invention. For example, a plurality of (i.e. two or more) layers of collagenous material, for example submucosa-containing or other ECM material, can be bonded together to form a multilaminate structure.

The patent in question is titled Prostate-specific membrane antigen binding proteins and related compositions and methods.  The extract of text citing that article is: ellâ€”surface membrane protein that is not secreted, which makes it an ideal target for antibody therapy. PROSTASCINTÂ® (capromab pendetide) is an  111 In-labelled anti-PSMA murine monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA for imaging and staging of newly diagnosed and recurrent prostate cancer patients (Hinkle et al.,  Cancer  1998, 83:739-747). However, capromab binds to an intracellular epitope of PSMA, requiring internalization or exposure of the internal domain of PSMA, therefore preferentially binding apoptotic or necrosing cells (Troyer et al.,  Urologic Oncology: Seminars and Original Investigations  1995 1:29-37; Troyer et al.,  Prostate  1997 30:232-242). As a result, capromab may not be of therapeutic benefit (Liu et al.,  Cancer Res.  1997 57:3629-3634). 
     Other monoclonal antibodies which target the external domain of PSMA have been developed (e.g., J591, J415, J533, and E99) (Liu et al.,  Cancer Res.  1997 57:3629-3634). Radiolabelled J591 is currently in clinical trials (Tagawa et al., Cancer 2010 116(S4):1075). However, evidence suggests that PSMA may act as a receptor mediating the internalization of a putative ligand. PSMA undergoes internalization constitutively, and PSMA-specific antibodies can induce and/or increase the rate of internalization, which then causes the antibodies to accumulate in the endosomes (Liu et al.,  Cancer Res.  1998 58:4055-4060). While PSMA-specific internalizing antibodies may aid in the development of therapeutics to target the delivery of toxins, drugs, or radioisotopes to the interior of prostate cancer cells (Tagawa et al., Cancer 2010 116(S4):1075), PSMA-specific antibodies utilizing native or engineered effector mechanisms (e.g., antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP), or re-directed T-cell cytotoxicity (RTCC)) are problematic since the PSMA-specific antibody may be internalized before it is recognized by effector cells.

     Methylation Assay Procedures. Various methylation assay procedures are known in the art, and can be used in conjunction with the present invention. These assays allow for determination of the methylation state of one or a plurality of CpG dinucleotides (e.g., CpG islands) within a DNA sequence. Such assays involve, among other techniques, DNA sequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA, PCR (for sequence-specific amplification), Southern blot analysis, and use of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. 
     For example, genomic sequencing has been simplified for analysis of DNA methylation patterns and 5-methylcytosine distribution by using bisulfite treatment (Frommer et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:1827-1831, 1992). Additionally, restriction enzyme digestion of PCR products amplified from bisulfite-converted DNA is used, e.g., the method described by Sadri &amp; Hornsby (Nucl. Acids Res. 24:5058-5059, 1996), or COBRA (Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis) (Xiong &amp; Laird, Nucleic Acids Res. 25:2532-2534, 1997). 
     COBRA. COBRAâ„¢ analysis is a quantitative methylation assay useful for determining DNA methylation levels at specific gene loci in small amounts of genomic DNA (Xiong &amp; Laird, Nucleic Acids Res. 25:2532-2534, 1997). Briefly, restriction enzyme digestion is used to reveal methylation-dependent sequence differences in PCR products of sodium bisulfite-treated DNA. Methylation-dependent sequence differences are first introduced into the genomic DNA by standard bisulfite treatment according to the procedure described by Frommer t al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:1827-1831, 1992). PCR amplification of the bisulfite converted DNA is then performed using primers specific for the CpG islands of interest, followed by restriction endonuclease digestion, gel electrophoresis, and detection using specific, labeled hybridization probes.

The patent in question is titled Corrosion resistant positive grid for lead-acid batteries.  The extract of text citing that article is: lating layer thereby resulting in reduced passivation. It is also believed that some of the tin near the surface of the alloy migrates to and dopes positive active material, which allows for a more complete recovery from deep discharge. Specifically, it is believed that the addition of the tin helps to reduce the production of PbSO 4  or tetragonal PbO at the grid/active material interface when deeply discharged. These products can act as insulators that inhibit recharge except at very high potentials, which are not typically produced by automobile alternators. 
     It is important to note that, unlike in Pbâ€”Ca alloys, the presence of tin in the alloys of the present invention is not believed to enhance resistance to penetrating corrosion of the grid. Specifically, it is known that adding tin to high-Ca alloys (e.g., 0.06-0.08% Ca) such that the tin concentration is about 1% results in high-Ca alloys having similar or lower corrosion rates in acid media than low-Ca alloys. See, e.g., Prengaman, The Metallurgy and Performance of Cast and Rolled Lead Alloys for Battery Grids, Journal of Power Sources, 67 (1997) 267-278. For low-Ca or essentially Ca-free alloys such as those of the present invention, however, it is believed that tin modifies the interfacial barrier and increases grain sizes, which tend to make the alloy more prone to penetrating corrosion along the grain boundaries, which corrode preferentially, especially when exposed to high service temperatures. Despite the tin&#39;s tendency to increase penetrating corrosion, the reduction of which is a goal of the present invention, and its relatively high cost, it is believed that the benefits provided by tin are often justified for batteries that are likely to be subjected to deep discharge during service. 
     In one such embodiment, the tin concentration is at least about 0.2% (1,000 ppm). In another embodiment, the tin concentration is at least about 0.4% (4,000 ppm). In another embodiment, the tin concentration is at least about 0.5% (5,000 ppm). In yet another embodiment, the tin concentration is no greater than about 1.8% (18,0",0.65

The extract of text citing that article is: owever, when silicon is lithiated, it undergoes a large volume expansion (Ëœ300%). This in turn causes severe cracking of the silicon and leads to electrode failure. 
     Many research groups have focused on exploring a variety of silicon-based nanostructures, such as nanosized particles, thin film, silicon nanowires, silicon nanotubes, core-cell nanowires, porous silicon (PSi), and interconnected silicon hollow nanospheres. Many of these structures have shown success in addressing the mechanical breaking issues associated with silicon. 
     Recently, composite materials of porous silicon and carbon have also shown promising results. For instace, Bang et al. have synthesized a macroporous silicon anode using silver (Ag) nanoparticles as a template to chemically etch silicon particles, and a thermal decomposition method to coat the anode with a carbon layer ( Advanced Energy Materials,  2012, 2:878-883). The material demonstrated a capacity of 2050 mAhg âˆ’1  for fifty cycles. Likewise, Kim et al. have synthesized mesoporous Si/carbon core-shell nanowires as well as three dimensional (3-D) porous silicon (c-Si) particles ( Nano Letters,  2008, 8:3688-3691 and  Angewandte Chemie - International Edition,  2008, 47:10151-10154). Ge et al. have also shown that silicon nanowires grown and then scraped off from a substrate can be combined with an alginate binder ( Nano Letters,  2012, 12:2318-2323). They showed that this form of silicon with high porosity and large pore sizes results in materials with capacities over 1000 mAhgâˆ’ 1  for hundreds of cycles.

The patent in question is titled Processes for producing cycloalkylcarboxamido-pyridine benzoic acids.  The extract of text citing that article is: ion causing an imbalance in ion and fluid transport. The resulting decrease in anion transport contributes to enhanced mucus accumulation in the lung and the accompanying microbial infections that ultimately cause death in CF patients. In addition to respiratory disease, CF patients typically suffer from gastrointestinal problems and pancreatic insufficiency that, if left untreated, results in death. In addition, the majority of males with cystic fibrosis are infertile and fertility is decreased among females with cystic fibrosis. In contrast to the severe effects of two copies of the CF associated gene, individuals with a single copy of the CF associated gene exhibit increased resistance to cholera and to dehydration resulting from diarrheaâ€”perhaps explaining the relatively high frequency of the CF gene within the population. 
     Sequence analysis of the CFTR gene of CF chromosomes has revealed a variety of disease causing mutations (Cutting, G. R. et al. (1990) Nature 346:366-369; Dean, M. et al. (1990) Cell 61:863:870; and Kerem, B-S. et al. (1989) Science 245:1073-1080; Kerem, B-S et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:8447-8451). To date, &gt;1000 disease causing mutations in the CF gene have been identified (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/). The most prevalent mutation is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 of the CFTR amino acid sequence, and is commonly referred to as Î”F508-CFTR. This mutation occurs in approximately 70% of the cases of cystic fibrosis and is associated with a severe disease. 
     The deletion of residue 508 in Î”F508-CFTR prevents the nascent protein from folding correctly. This results in the inability of the mutant protein to exit the ER, and traffic to the plasma membrane. As a result, the number of channels present in the membrane is far less than observed in cells expressing wild-type CFTR. In addition to impaired trafficking, the mutation results in defective channel gating. Together, the reduced number of channels in the membrane and the defective gating lead to reduced anion transport across epithelia leading to defective ion",0.5

The patent in question is titled Variant factor VIII polypeptides and methods of their production and use.  The extract of text citing that article is: c and aPTT assays. For purified proteins, chromogenic activity was determined by Coatest FVIII:C (Instrumentation Laboratory; Bedford, Mass.), using 02-122 as a calibrator (NIBSC; Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, UK). Details of the chromogenic assay principles are described above. The aPTT activity of purified proteins was determined on the ACL TOP, using FVIII-BDD as a calibrator and the APTT-SP kit (Instrumentation Laboratory; Bedford, Mass.). Further details of the one-stage aPTT assay principles are described above. Specific activity of purified proteins was calculated using A280 to determine the protein concentrations. 
     Results 
     Numerous variants of FVIII-BDD with amino acid substitutions at positions within the thrombin cleavage site at amino acids 370-375 were produced and investigated (see Table 1). Preferred thrombin cleavage sequences were based on the ability of thrombin to cleave specific linear peptide sequences over others using kinetic fluorogenic substrate assay (Bianchini et al., J. Biol. Chem. 277:20527 (2002)). Surprisingly, one variant that was previously predicted to be containing an â€œoptimalâ€ thrombin cleavage site (Bianchini et al., J. Biol. Chem. 277:20527 (2002)) showed poor aPTT activity (variant â€œaâ€ in Table 1). Other variants with partial correspondence to the predicted â€œoptimalâ€ consensus sequence (variants b and c in Table 1) displayed enhanced aPTT activity. Without wanting to be limited in any way by theory, the discrepancy from the predicted â€œoptimalâ€ thrombin cleavage site may be due partly to the limited capacity to extrapolate from thrombin interaction with small, linear peptide sequences to thrombin&#39;s interaction with large, three-dimensional proteins. Nevertheless, the enhanced aPTT activity of â€œbâ€ and â€œcâ€ indicated that these FVIII mutants were more efficiently activated under aPTT conditions, e.g., limited activated coagulation factor initiation.

     This application is a U.S. National Phase application under 35 U.S.C. Â§371 of PCT Application No. PCT/US2013/075235, filed Dec. 16, 2013, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. Â§119(c) from U.S. Ser. No. 61/739,844, filed Dec. 20, 2012. 
     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     The orexins (hypocretins) comprise two neuropeptides produced in the hypothalamus: the orexin A (OX-A) (a 33 amino acid peptide) and the orexin B (OX-B) (a 28 amino acid peptide) (Sakurai T. et al., Cell, 1998, 92, 573-585). Orexins are found to stimulate food consumption in rats suggesting a physiological role for these peptides as mediators in the central feedback mechanism that regulates feeding behavior (Sakurai T. et al., Cell, 1998, 92, 573-585). Orexins regulate states of sleep and wakefulness opening potentially novel therapeutic approaches for narcoleptic or insomniac patients (Chemelli R. M. et al., Cell, 1999, 98, 437-451). Orexins have also been indicated as playing a role in arousal, reward, learning and memory (Harris, et al., Trends Neurosci., 2006, 29 (10), 571-577). Two orexin receptors have been cloned and characterized in mammals. They belong to the super family of G-protein coupled receptors (Sakurai T. et al., Cell, 1998, 92, 573-585): the orexin-1 receptor (OX or OX1R) is selective for OX-A and the orexin-2 receptor (OX2 or OX2R) is capable to bind OX-A as well as OX-B. The physiological actions in which orexins are presumed to participate are thought to be expressed via one or both of OX1 receptor and OX2 receptor as the two subtypes of orexin receptors.

     The present invention is directed to 3-ester-4-substituted compounds which are antagonists of orexin recep",0.01

( Nature Genet.,  6:119-29, 1994) presents a detailed consideration of sequence alignment methods and homology calculations. 
     The alignment tools ALIGN (Myers and Miller,  CABIOS  4:11-17, 1989) or LFASTA (Pearson and Lipman, 1988) may be used to perform sequence comparisons (Internet ProgramÂ© 1996, W. R. Pearson and the University of Virginia, â€œfasta20u63â€ version 2.0u63, release date December 1996). ALIGN compares entire sequences against one another, while LFASTA compares regions of local similarity. These alignment tools and their respective tutorials are available on the Internet at the NCSA website. Alternatively, for comparisons of amino acid sequences of greater than about 30 amino acids, the â€œBlast 2 sequencesâ€ function can be employed using the default BLOSUM62 matrix set to default parameters, (gap existence cost of 11, and a per residue gap cost of 1).

The patent in question is titled Methods of microbial oil extraction and separation.  The extract of text citing that article is: to be treated to increase the accessible surface area or for the cellulose to be first broken down as a preparation for microbial utilization as a carbon source. Ways of preparing or pretreating cellulosic material for enzyme digestion are well known in the art. The methods are divided into two main categories: (1) breaking apart the cellulosic material into smaller particles to increase the accessible surface area; and (2) chemically treating the cellulosic material to create a useable substrate for enzyme digestion. 
     Methods for increasing the accessible surface area include steam explosion, which involves the use of steam at high temperatures to break apart cellulosic materials. Because of the high temperature requirement of this process, some of the sugars in the cellulosic material may be lost, thus reducing the available carbon source for enzyme digestion (see for example, Chahal, D. S. et al.,  Proceedings of the  2 nd    World Congress of Chemical Engineering ; (1981) and Kaar et al.,  Biomass and Bioenergy  (1998) 14(3): 277-87) Ammonia explosion allows for explosion of cellulosic material at a lower temperature, but is more costly to perform and the ammonia might interfere with subsequent enzyme digestion processes (see for example, Dale, B. E. et al.,  Biotechnology and Bioengineering  (1982); 12: 31-43). Another explosion technique involves the use of supercritical carbon dioxide explosion to break the cellulosic material into smaller fragments (see for example, Zheng et al.,  Biotechnology Letters  (1995); 17(8): 845-850). 
     Methods for chemically treating the cellulosic material to create useable substrates for enzyme digestion are also known in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 7,413,882, incorporated herein by reference, describes the use of genetically engineered microbes that secrete beta-glucosidase into the fermentation broth and treating cellulosic material with the fermentation broth to enhance the hydrolysis of cellulosic material into glucose.

The patent in question is titled Intravascular sensing method and system.  The extract of text citing that article is: stenosis), the other pressure reading is taken on the proximal side of the stenosis (e.g., upstream from the stenosis and closer to the aorta). The FFR is defined as the ratio of maximal blood flow in a stenotic artery, taken distal to the lesion, to normal maximal flow, and is typically calculated based on a measured pressure gradient of the distal pressure to the proximal pressure. The FFR is therefore a unitless ratio of the distal and proximal pressures. The pressure gradient, or pressure drop, across a stenotic lesion is an indicator of the severity of the stenosis, and the FFR is a useful tool in assessing the pressure drop. The more restrictive the stenosis is, the greater the pressure drop, and the lower the resulting FFR. 
     The FFR measurement may be a useful diagnostic and treatment planning tool. For example, clinical studies have shown that an FFR of less than about 0.75 may be a useful criterion on which to base certain therapy decisions. An example of such a study is Pijls, DeBruyne et al., Measurement of Fractional Flow Reserve to Assess the Functional Severity of Coronary-Artery Stenoses, 334:1703-1708, New England Journal of Medicine, Jun. 27, 1996. A physician might decide, for example, to perform an interventional procedure (e.g., angioplasty or stent placement) when the FFR for a given stenotic lesion is below 0.75, and may decide to forego such treatment for lesions where the FFR is above 0.75. In other studies, the cut off value for the FFR at which an intervention is performed is 0.80. Thus, the FFR measurement can provide a decision point for guiding treatment decisions. 
     One method of measuring blood pressure for use in calculating FFR is to use a pressure sensing guidewire. Such a device has a pressure sensor embedded within the guidewire itself. A pressure sensing guidewire could be used in the deployment of interventional devices such as angioplasty balloons or stents. To use a pressure sensing guidewire, in certain applications the guidewire must be repositioned so the sensing element of the guidewire is correctly placed with respect to a stenotic lesion, for example.

The patent in question is titled Heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes or oxidative coupling of methane.  The extract of text citing that article is: ion on the BN surface ( FIG. 11A ) and second-order dependence with respect to P C3H8  ( FIG. 11B ). This kinetic behavior clearly distinguishes boron nitride from traditional supported vanadia catalysts, which follow a Mars van Krevelen mechanism (rate-determining substrate oxidation, followed by fast re-oxidation of the surface by oxygen) that typically leads to zero-order rate dependence with respect to P O2  and first order in propane (K. Chen, A. Khodakov, J. Yang, A. T. Bell, E. Iglesia,  J. Catal.,  186, 325-333 (1999)). 
     It is surprising that BN, a material known for its high stability under oxidative conditions (Z. Liu, Y. Gong, W. Zhou, L. Ma, J. Yu, J. C. Idrobo, J. Jung, A. H. MacDonald, R. Vajtai, J. Lou, P. M. Ajayan,  Nat. Commun.,  4, 2541 (2013); Y. Chen, J. Zou, S. J. Campbell, G. L. Caer,  Appl. Phys. Lett.,  84, 2430-2432 (2004)), is catalytically active at all. So far it has been explored for its unique electronic, thermoelectric and mechanical properties (Y. Lin, J. W. Connell,  Nanoscale,  4, 6908-6939 (2012); N. G. Chopra, R. J. Luyken, K. Cherrey, V. H.

Sumpter,  J. Phys. Chem. C,  116, 15675-15681 (2012)). The combination of the interesting observations outlined in this example (i.e. improved selectivity to olefins and different reaction kinetics) points towards a novel, fundamentally different reaction mechanism compared to other, well-studied catalysts. Metal impurities in the material are unlikely to play a significant role. Indeed, various boron nitride samples from various suppliers, containing different impurities ( FIG. 12 ) show almost identical catalytic performance ( FIGS. 13-14 ).

Of course, varying p may result in additional or less signal detection robustness.
 
     By formulating data hiding as an optimization problem, other printing press or design-related constraints can be put in place. For example, designers may not allow a spot color ink to be screened due to physical press reasons, or may limit the amount of screening. By including the spot ink in Î± min  and Î± max  without any constraint will allow the spot ink to be modulated by the watermark tile. For example, a specific spot ink is moved from the fixed-ink path in  FIG. 7  to the optimization path and is included in the optimization process along with CMY inks. Min and max tweaks then may include a spot ink component and the watermark tile can be embedded by interpolating between these two colors as described previously for the CMY case. 
     The optimization problem in Eq. (9) can be solved numerically with, e.g., the IPOPT library, using the underlying technology detailed in A. Wachter and L. T. Biegler, â€œOn the implementation of a primal-dual interior point filter line search algorithm for large-scale nonlinear programming.â€ Mathematical Programming, Vol. 106, issue (1): pages 25-57, 2006, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. IPOPT code is available as open source, e.g., at http://www.coin-or.org/Ipopt. 
     Such an optimization can be carried out for a given image area, e.g., a spot color area have the same color values. Additionally, the optimization can be carried out for each image area including different color values. This might include optimizing an entire image or image area on a per pixel basis, or on an area by area basis. 
       FIG. 11  provides a graphical framework to consider some aspects of our color embedding optimization technology, e.g., as previously discussed relative to  FIG. 7 . SC 1  represents a first color. To generalize an optimization system, there can be at least 3 components: i) system space, ii) variables to optimize, and iii) system constraints. In one implementation the space may include a color gamut defined by a first color channel (SC channel) and four process colors CMYK. Of course, the space may inclu",0.98

     More specifically, in an ADC, the antibody is conjugated to a drug, with the antibody functioning as a targeting agent for directing the ADC to a target cell expressing its antigen, such as a cancer cell. Preferably, the antigen is a tumor associated antigen, i.e., one that is uniquely expressed or overexpressed by the cancer cell. Once there, the drug is released, either inside the target cell or in its vicinity, to act as a therapeutic agent.

The patent in question is titled Mass spectrometric assays for peptides.  The extract of text citing that article is: le groups covalently attached to the KLH, each of which comprises a linker segment 2 and a maleimide reactive group 2 (â€œMâ€). This modification is accomplished by reaction of purified KLH with 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid 3-sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (a heterobifunctional crosslinking reagent that reacts with protein primary amino groups to provide sulfhydryl-reactive maleimide groups on the protein surface). 
     SIS peptides are chemically synthesized with an n-terminal sequence extension containing a cysteine residue (whose sulfhydryl reacts with maleimide to yield a stable chemical bond), several spacer amino acids (here -GSG-, SEQ ID No. 1) and a final lysine (K) residue adjacent to the SIS n-terminus, creating a tryptic cleavage site. Peptide synthesis is typically carried out on a solid phase resin (Merrifield, Methods Enzymol 289:3-13, 1997), and can include steps to ligate together multiple synthetic peptides to produce larger peptides or proteins (Dawson, Muir, Clark-Lewis and Kent, Science 266:776-9, 1994, Dawson and Kent, Annu Rev Biochem 69:923-60, 2000). One embodiment makes use of stable isotope labeled K and R, since each tryptic SIS peptide contains only one such residue (either K or R) per peptide at the c-terminus, thus simplifying the calculation of mass shifts in the y-ion fragment series often used for selected reaction monitoring (SRM) quantitation in tandem mass spectrometry. Incorporation of labeled K or R is achieved through use of the corresponding labeled K or R synthons commercially available for solid phase peptide synthesis. Alternatively any amino acid containing stable isotope labels can be used. 
     Thus, the SIS peptide â€œEIGELYLPK*â€ (SEQ ID No. 5, corresponding to a tryptic peptide of human alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and incorporating a c-terminal stable isotope-labeled lysine shown as K* and described as U- 13 C 6 , 98%;U- 15 N 2 ,98%, thus, having a mass 8 amu greater than the unlabeled natural analyte peptide of the same sequence) is synthesized as the extended SIS peptide sequence â€œCGSGKEIGELYLPK*â€ (SEQ ID N",0.99

The patent in question is titled Phospholipase C gamma 2 and resistance associated mutations.  The extract of text citing that article is: e substrate, or a peptide or molecule that binds to a second detectable molecule. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide probe is specific for nucleic acid encoding serine at a position corresponding to amino acid 742, 845, or 1140 of a PLCÎ³2 polypeptide. 
     In some embodiments, the DNA encoding the mutant PLCÎ³2 is assessed by BEAMing (beads, amplification, emulsion, magnetic) PCR sequencing method (see, e.g., Li et al. (2006)  Nat Methods.  3(2):95-7; Li et al. (2006)  Nat Methods.  3(7):551-9; and Diehl et al. (2008)  Nat Med.  14(9): 985-990). BEAMing is a technique in which individual DNA molecules are attached to magnetic beads in water-in-oil emulsions and then subjected to compartmentalized PCR amplification. The mutational status of DNA bound to beads is then determined by hybridization to fluorescent allele-specific probes for, for example, mutant or wild-type PLCÎ³2. Flow cytometry is then used to quantify the level of mutant DNA present in the plasma or serum (see e.g., Higgins et al. (2012)  Clin Cancer Res  18: 3462-3469). 
     In some embodiments, testing the sample comprises denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (D-HPLC). D-HPLC relies upon the differential retention kinetics of heteroduplex/homoduplex DNA species within a cartridge matrix designed to separate DNA fragments according to charge density against an electrolyte gradient. (see e.g., Frueh et al (2003)  Clin Chem Lab Med.  41(4):452-61). 
     In some embodiments, testing the sample comprises nanofluidics, including using NanoPro to determine the pI differences in a wild-type or mutant polypeptide bound to an inhibitor. For example, NanoPro can be used to determine the pI differences in a wild-type PLCÎ³2 polypeptide covalently bound to a PLCÎ³2 inhibitor at amino acid position 742, 845, or 1140 and mutant PLCÎ³2 polypeptide (e.g., having a modification that is R742P, L845F, D1140G) that does not covalently bind to the PLCÎ³2 inhibitor.

As such, microarray technology is a tremendously useful tool for scientific investigators and clinicians in their understanding of diseases and therapeutic regimen efficacy in treating diseases. 
     The genome is typically too complex to be studied as a whole, and techniques must be used to reduce the complexity of the genome. To address this problem, one solution is to reduce certain types of abundant sequences from a DNA sample, as found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,013,440. Alternatives employ methods and compositions for enriching genomic sequences as described, for example, in Albert et al. (2007, Nat. Meth., 4:903-5), Okou et al. (2007, Nat. Meth. 4:907-9), Olson M. (2007, Nat. Meth. 4:891-892), Hodges et al. (2007, Nat. Genet. 39:1522-1527) and as found in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11/638,004, 11/970,949, and 61/032,594. Albert et al. disclose an alternative that is both cost-effective and rapid in effectively reducing the complexity of a genomic sample in a user defined way to allow for further processing and analysis. Lovett et al. (1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 88:9628-9632) also describes a method for genomic selection using a bacterial artificial chromosomes. However, existing methods are limited by, for example, their ease of use and inflexibility of materials and methods. 
     Prior art microarray technology, be it enrichment technology or otherwise, is typically a substrate associated technology with inherent variability, such as microarray slides, chips, and the like.

     At least six viral vector approaches are currently available for gene transfer in clinical trials, which utilize approaches that involve complementation of defective vectors by genes inserted into helper cell lines to generate the transducing agent. 
     pLASN and MFG-S are examples of retroviral vectors that have been used in clinical trials (Dunbar et al.,  Blood  85:3048-305 (1995); Kohn et al.,  Nat.

Transduction efficiencies of 50% or greater have been observed for MFG-S packaged vectors. (Ellem et al.,  Immunol Immunother.  44(1):10-20 (1997); Dranoff et al.,  Hum. Gene Ther.  1:111-2 (1997). 
     Recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors (rAAV) are a promising alternative gene delivery systems based on the defective and nonpathogenic parvovirus adeno-associated type 2 virus. All vectors are derived from a plasmid that retains only the AAV 145 bp inverted terminal repeats flanking the transgene expression cassette. Efficient gene transfer and stable transgene delivery due to integration into the genomes of the transduced cell are key features for this vector system.

The patent in question is titled Sling-based treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.  The extract of text citing that article is: priate staining. Such non-collagenous solids can constitute a significant percentage of the dry weight of the ECM material in certain inventive embodiments, for example at least about 1%, at least about 3%, and at least about 5% by weight in various embodiments of the invention. 
     The submucosa-containing or other ECM material used in the inventive slings may also exhibit an angiogenic character and thus be effective to induce angiogenesis in a host engrafted with the material. In this regard, angiogenesis is the process through which the body makes new blood vessels to generate increased blood supply to tissues. Thus, angiogenic materials, when contacted with host tissues, promote or encourage the formation of new blood vessels into the materials. Methods for measuring in vivo angiogenesis in response to biomaterial implantation have recently been developed. For example, one such method uses a subcutaneous implant model to determine the angiogenic character of a material. See, C. Heeschen et al., Nature Medicine 7 (2001), No. 7, 833-839. When combined with a fluorescence microangiography technique, this model can provide both quantitative and qualitative measures of angiogenesis into biomaterials. C.

The patent in question is titled Amino acid derivatives.  The extract of text citing that article is: ine at amber codons in  E. coli . They also showed that the wt PyIRS is naturally promiscuous and can incorporate analogs of lysine. 
     Yokoyama et al (EP1911840) demonstrated that the PyIRS/tRNApyl system is orthogonal in eukaryotic cells and showed the incorporation of several non natural amino acids (nnAAs) into a target proteins encoded by amber codons in bacterial cells. These authors also identified key amino acid residues in pyIRS that form the amino acid binding pocket and function in selecting pyrrolysine over other canonical amino acids. Mutations at this site generated mutants able the recognize and aminoacylate the tRNApyl with AzZ-lys (Yanagisawa 2008). 
     This orthogonality extends to bacteria and eukaryotic cells. 
     PyIRS is a naturally promiscuous synthetase that has naturally evolved to exclude lysine, but will incorporate lysine analogs without mutation, including azides, alkynes and alkenes, (Yanagisawa et al, 2008; Neumann et al. 2008; Mukai et al., 2008; Nguyen et al., 2009). The basis of this specificity is dependent on hydrophobic interactions between amino acid residues of the pyIRS binding pocket with the pyrrole ring of pyrrolysine that stabilizes and correctly positions the amino acid in the active site of the synthetase (Kavran et al., 2007). This RS/tRNA pair has been introduced via transient transfection into bacterial, yeast and mammalian cells and shown to be effective for incorporation of a number of non-natural amino acids into target proteins. 
     For instance, EP 1911840 demonstrates incorporation of N-Îµ-boc-Lysine into a target protein in  E. coli  cells. 
     Pyrrolysine analogs, defined as amino acid derivatives recognized by either native or genetically evolved PyIRS and incorporated into proteins at amber codon sites, have been disclosed in the past few years and reviewed, for instance, by Feckner et. al (Fekner, Li, &amp; Chan, 2010) and Liu et al.

The patent in question is titled Floating evaporative assembly of aligned carbon nanotubes.  The extract of text citing that article is: antity of s-SWCNTs. 
     By decoupling the s-SWCNT stripe formation from the evaporation of the bulk solution and by iteratively applying the s-SWCNTs in controlled doses, the dose-controlled, floating evaporative self-assembly process formed stripes in which the s-SWCNTs were aligned within Â±14Â°, were packed at a density of Ëœ50 s-SWCNTs Î¼m âˆ’1 , and constituted primarily a well-ordered monodispersed layer. FET devices incorporating the stripes showed high performance with a mobility of 38 cm 2 v âˆ’1 s âˆ’1  and on/off ratio of 2.2Ã—10 6  at a 9 Î¼m channel length. 
     Results and Discussion 
     Two different types of s-SWCNT inks were examined. The first type of ink was processed from arc-discharge SWCNT powders (Nano Lab, Inc.). In this case, the polyfluorene derivative poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-co-(6,6â€²-{2,2â€²-bipyridine})] (PFO-BPy), was employed as a semiconductor-selective polymer. PFO-BPy has been shown to selectively wrap highly semiconducting SWCNT species. (See, Mistry, K. S.; Larsen, B. A.; Blackburn, J. L. High-Yield Dispersions of Large-Diameter Semiconducting Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Tunable Narrow Chirality Distributions.  ACS Nano  2013, 7, 2231-2239.) The arc-discharge powder and PFO-BPy were dispersed in toluene by ultrasonication where the PFO-BPy wrapped s-SWCNTs were solubilized, while leaving the remaining carbon residuals and m-SWCNTs in large bundles and aggregates, which were removed by centrifugation. Absorption spectra of the sorted and unsorted SWCNT solutions were obtained for comparison. Metallic peaks present in the unsorted spectra around 700 nm were absent after sorting with PFO-BPy. Following the initial sorting process excess polymer chains were removed by repeated dispersion and centrifugation of the SWCNTs in tetrahydrofuran. The second type of ink was processed from high pressure carbon monoxide (HiPco) produced powders (Nanointegris Inc.). In this case the polyfluorene derivative poly[(9,9-di-n-octylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)] (PFO) was used as a semiconductor-selective polymer. (See, Nish, A.; Hwang, J. Y.; Doig, J.; Nicholas, R. J.

The patent in question is titled Method of selectively inhibiting Ras-mediated tumor growth in humans.  The extract of text citing that article is: overed. The name â€œrasâ€ also is used to refer to the family of genes encoding these proteins. 
     Ras-driven cancers have remained the most intractable diseases to any available treatment. New therapeutic and preventative strategies are urgently needed for such cancers (Stephen et al.,  Cancer Cell,  25, 272-281 (2014)). Drug discovery programs worldwide have sought Ras-selective drugs for many years, but heretofore no avail (Spiegel, et al.,  Nature Chem. Biol.,  10, 613-622 (2014)). New drugs that selectively target abnormal or mutant Ras and/or Ras-mediated pathological processes in patients&#39; tumors will enable highly efficacious treatments of such patients while minimizing toxicity to cells and tissues with normal Ras functions (Stephen et al., supra; Spiegel et al., supra). 
     Ras proteins are key regulators of several aspects of normal cell growth and malignant transformation, including cellular proliferation, survival and invasiveness, tumor angiogenesis and metastasis (Downward,  Nature Rev. Cancer,  3, 11-22 (2003)). Ras proteins are abnormally active in most human tumors due to mutations in the ras genes themselves, or in upstream or downstream Ras pathway components, or other alterations in Ras signaling. Targeted therapies that inhibit Ras-mediated pathways therefore are expected to inhibit the growth, proliferation, survival and spread of tumor cells having activated or mutant Ras. Some such new experimental therapeutic agents have shown promising activity in preclinical studies, albeit with only modest activity in human clinical trials. 
     Genetic mutations in ras genes were first identified in human cancer over 3 decades ago. Such mutations result in the activation of one or more of three major Ras protein isoforms, including H-Ras, N-Ras, or K-Ras, that turn on signaling pathways leading to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor development. Activating ras gene mutations occur de novo in approximately one third of all human cancers and are especially prevalent in pancreatic, colorectal, a",0.01

The patent in question is titled System and method for the detection of gamma radiation from a radioactive analyte.  The extract of text citing that article is: er Phase I Study of Patients with Advanced Gastrointestinal Malignancies,â€ 50 J. Nucl. Med. (No. 10) 1646-1654 (October 2009). In local practices and even in practices and research centers employing Quality Assurance checks, these issues with SUV calculations have left oncologists and researchers needing to see significant changes in SUV values to be somewhat assured they are making sound treatment decisions or reaching proper research conclusions. 
     While using SUVs comparisons from PET/CT static images are currently the most advanced way in clinical practices to assess tumor response to treatment, the use of dynamic images (PET images taken at various times during the uptake of the radio-labeled tracers) has provided researchers with kinetic information regarding the uptake of radio-labeled tracers. In the academic community, this kinetic information is proving to be an even better method of assessing treatment and predicting patient outcomes than using static SUVs. (See Lisa K. Dunnwald, â€œPET Tumor Metabolism in Locally Advanced Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: Value of Static versus Kinetic Measures of Fluorodeoxyglucose Uptake,â€ Clin. Cancer Res. 2011;17:2400-2409 (published online first Mar. 1, 2011)). Unfortunately, this dynamic PET approach takes approximately three times as long as a static PET/CT scan and thus would require several more PET scanners at each hospital; it is clinically and economically impractical for widespread adoption and clinical use. So while there have been great improvements in the past few decades regarding cancer treatment options, today&#39;s oncologists and researchers continue to lack a timely, cost-effective, and fast way to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatments they deliver or the research they are conducting. 
     In light of the problems associated with current tumor measurement and prediction systems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a way to identify improperly administered radio-labeled tracer injections (infiltrations or extravasation), which negatively impact tumor uptake and PET results, and an easier, less costly, and more efficient system and method for measuring and predicting the status and/or changes in biol",0.29

The resultant alkyne of Formula 8.3 may then be subjected to a Sonogashira coupling with an aryl or heteroaryl halide of Formula 8.4 (where hal=bromine or iodine) using standard conditions known to those skilled in the art (see R. Chinchilla et al.,  Chem. Soc. Rev.  2011, 40, 5084-5121) to afford a compound of Formula 8.5. This intermediate is then subjected to a cyclization reaction mediated by a platinum catalyst such as di-Î¼-chlorodichlorobis(ethylene)diplatinum(II) and an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid in a solvent such as CH 2 Cl 2  to afford a dihydrofuran intermediate of Formula 8.6. Finally, transfer hydrogenation using ammonium formate and a suitable catalyst such as palladium hydroxide on carbon in a solvent such as methanol affords amine 8.7, which is subset of Formula 2.2, wherein y=1, R 2a â•CH 3 , R 2b â•H, A=tetrahydrofuranyl, and R 3 =aryl or heteroaryl.

     The expression of DLL4 can be induced by VEGF (Liu et al.,  Mol. Cell Biol.,  23(1): 14-25 (2003); Lobov et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,  104(9): 3219-3224 (2007)). VEGF is a signal protein produced by cells involved in angiogenesis. Additionally, DLL4 can negatively regulate VEGF signaling, in part through repressing VEGFR2 and inducing VEGR1 (Harrington et al.,  Microvasc. Res.,  75(2): 144-154 (2008); Suchting et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,  104(9): 3225-3230 (2007)). Exquisite coordination between DLL4 and VEGF is essential for functional angiogenesis, making both DLL4 and VEGF potential targets for therapeutic intervention. 
     In addition to their physiological role, DLL4 and VEGF are also up-regulated in tumor blood vessels (Gale et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,  101(45): 15949-15954 (2004); Mailhos et al.,  Differentiation,  69(2-3): 135-144 (2001); Patel et al.,  Cancer Res.,  65(19): 8690-8697 (2005); Patel et al.,  Clin.

Blockade of DLL4 has been shown to inhibit primary tumor growth in multiple models (Noguera-Troise et al.,  Nature,  444(7122): 1032-1037 (2006); Ridgway et al.,  Nature,  444(7122): 1083-1087 (2006); Scehnet et al.,  Blood,  109(11): 4753-4760 (2007)). The inhibition of DLL4 is even effective against tumors that are resistant to anti-VEGF therapy. Thus, the combinatorial inhibition of both DLL4 and VEGF could provide an enhanced anti-tumor therapy. Interestingly, unlike VEGF inhibition that reduces tumor vessel formation, DLL4 blockade leads to an increase in tumor vasculature density wherein the vessels are abnormal, cannot support efficient blood transport, and are effectively nonfunctional. Thus, disruption of both VEGF and DLL4 provides for different methods of action for potential anti-cancer treatment.

     Example 6 
     Polyglutamine Model 
     In disease states where aberrant peptides slowly accumulate in the brain, early neuronal death with glial hypertrophy occurs. In Huntington&#39;s disease, polyglutamine sequences or tracts accumulate in the huntingtin protein. These tracts bind to and inhibit transcription complexes containing Sp-1 and TAFII130 coactivators. Transcription rates decrease, and dysregulated neurons slowly die, first in the caudate nucleus and later in the hippocampus. 
     Non-proliferating, non-replaceable neurons usually die from metabolic redox imbalances, rather than from programmed death. Therefore, neuronal death in Huntington&#39;s disease is likely to be redox-mediated and induced by activation of redox-sensitive cytokines, metalloproteases, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activated migroglia and astrocytes (Chen et al.,  Nature Med.  797-801, 2000). In that case, reduced thiol redox-modulators, which at low doses promote cell growth and longevity in redox-suppressed cells, should prove to be useful therapy (Dunah et al.,  Science  296: 2238-2243, 2002). 
     In other neurodegenerative syndromes in which aberrant peptides accumulate, including Alzheimer&#39;s and Parkinson&#39;s diseases, presenilin or synucleins may be responsible for accumulation of the Lewy bodies and Î²-amyloid peptides. Accumulation of these hydrophobic peptides in plasma, mitochondrial, or endoplasmic reticulum membranes of the cell may be responsible for the neuronal losses in these syndromes. These toxic peptides, like the polyglutamine proteins in Huntington&#39;s disease, also lead to astroglia-induced imbalances in thiol redox metabolism, with cell swelling, membrane leakiness, and mitochondrial necrosis. Maintenance of thiol redox status with reduced thiol redox modulators, especially an amino phthalazinedione and acetyl cysteine, should prevent or d",0.41

The patent in question is titled Selective high-affinity polydentate ligands and methods of making such.  The extract of text citing that article is: eriments. At the highest concentration of hexa-arginine SHAL tested in the cell binding studies, the amount of residualized SHAL was equivalent to Ëœ1.1Ã—10 6  SHAL molecules per cellâ€”the same number of HLA-DR10 molecules reported previously to be present on the surface of each Raji cell (Epstein et al. (1987)  Cancer Res  47:830-840). These results, together with the confocal images showing the majority of the hexa-arginine SHAL is internalized, indicate that a significant fraction of the SHAL may be bound to the pool of HLA-DR10 known to be present inside the cell. 
     The observed enhancement in residualization of  111 In-labeled hexa-arginine SHAL by Raji cells and the potential association of a fraction of the  111 In-label with the nucleus are also important because radioisotope internalization and residualization have been shown to be highly advantageous for cancer therapy (Brouwers et al. (2003)  Clin Cancer Res  9:3953S-3960S; Chen et al. (2006)  J Nucl Med  2006, 47:827-836; Michel et al. (2002)  Clin Cancer Res  8:2632-2639; Stein et al. (2995)  Clin Cancer Res  11:2727-2734). Cancer therapeutics have been linked to a variety of radioisotopes that emit beta particles, alpha particles or Auger electrons. The range of beta emissions from isotopes routinely used in radioimmunotherapy, such as iodine-131, yttrium-90, and rhenium-188, extend for several millimeters, and therapeutics carrying these radionuclides create a â€œcrossfireâ€ (DeNardo (2005)  Semin Oncol.,  32:S27-35; Bischof 92003)  Leuk Lymphoma  44 Suppl 4:S29-36) or â€œbystanderâ€ (Boyd et al. (2006)  J Nucl Med  47:1007-1015) effect destroying malignant cells to which the targeting agent is not directly bound. In this way, beta-emitters can potentially overcome resistance due to antigen-negative tumor cells. These characteristics make beta-particle therapy better suited for treating bulky tumors or large-volume disease. However, longer-ranged beta emissions can also destroy nearby normal cells.

     IgH Knockouts 
     To create a null mutation in the chicken heavy chain locus, the single JH segment was deleted, which is a necessary domain in all immunoglobulins produced by the endogenous immune system. 
     To design a targeting vector that deletes the JH segment in chicken PGCs, it was first necessary to identify genomic flanking sequences to use as 5â€² and 3â€² homology regions. The chicken genome databases were queried, using the published JH and D sequences (Reynaud et al Cell. 1989 59:171-83) and published sequence near the SÎ¼ switch region. Several contigs could then be assembled in silico, although gaps remained between the D, JH and switch region contigs ( FIG. 4 ). These gaps needed to be bridged in order to build a targeting vector for the JH segment. PCR was used to amplify products across the region, spanning the gaps. PCR was performed using template genomic DNA from the PGC cell line used for targeting (Nu69, aka WL43). Alignment of these PCR product sequences produced a single long contig spanning over 9.7 kb around the JH segment, from 2.3 kb upstream to 7.4 kb downstream of the JH ( FIG. 5 ). Comparison of these sequences to the available database sequences showed a high degree of sequence divergence ( FIG. 5 ). The new sequence indicates that the gaps in the published sequence are predicted to be about 200 bp on the 5â€² side of JH and about 2 kb on the 3â€² side.

For example, a preformed complex of the target enzyme and the interactive cellular or extracellular binding partner product or substrate is prepared in that either the target enzyme or their binding partners or substrates are labeled, but the signal generated by the label is quenched due to complex formation (See, e.g., U.S. Pat.

The addition of a test substance that competes with and displaces one of the species from the preformed complex will result in the generation of a signal above background. In this way, test compounds that disrupt target enzyme-binding partner or substrate contact can be identified.

Cytotoxic fragments of PE include PE40, PE38, and PE35. 
     In preferred embodiments, the PE has been modified to reduce or eliminate nonspecific cell binding, frequently by deleting domain Ia as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,892,827, although this can also be achieved, for example, by mutating certain residues of domain Ia. U.S. Pat. No. 5,512,658, for instance, discloses that a mutated PE in which Domain Ia is present but in which the basic residues of domain Ia at positions 57, 246, 247, and 249 are replaced with acidic residues (glutamic acid, or â€œEâ€)) exhibits greatly diminished non-specific cytotoxicity. This mutant form of PE is sometimes referred to as PE4E. 
     PE40 is a truncated derivative of PE as previously described in the art, with a deletion of domain 1a of the native PE molecule. See, Pai, et al.,  Proc. Nat&#39;l Acad. Sci USA  55:3358-62 (1991); and Kondo, et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.  263:9470-9475 (1988). PE35 is a 35 kD carboxyl-terminal fragment of PE in which amino acid residues 1-279 have been deleted and the molecule commences with a met at position 280 followed by amino acids 281-364 and 381-613 of native PE. PE35 and PE40 are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,602,095 and 4,892,827.

     BACKGROUND 
     Cancer is a debilitating disease that accounts for more than half a million deaths each year. There is a profound need for more effective, selective and safe treatments for cancer. Existing treatments for this pervasive, life threatening disease, such as chemotherapy and surgery, rarely eliminate all malignant cells, and often exhibit deleterious side-effects that can outweigh therapeutic benefit. 
     One approach that has the potential to address many of the shortcomings of current cancer treatments is oncolytic adenoviral therapy (Pesonen, S. et al.,  Molecular Pharmaceutics ,. 8(1): p. 12-28 (2010)). These viruses are designed to replicate specifically in cancer cells, but leave normal cells unharmed. One way to engineer tumor selectivity is to target adenovirus infection to receptors upregulated on tumor cells, for example EGFR family members (Zhang H, Berezov A, Wang Q, Zhang G, Drebin J, Murali R, et al. ErbB receptors: from oncogenes to targeted cancer therapies. J Clin Invest. 2007; 117(8):2051-8. PMCID: 1934579), CEACAM (Li H J, Everts M, Pereboeva L, Komarova S, Idan A, Curiel D T, et al.

     Alp and TM Activate the MEK-ERK Self-renewal Pathway in SKPs 
     To assess whether Alp and TM activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal regulated kinase (MEK-ERK) pathway in SKPs, dissociated SKPs were cultured for 24 hours and 100 nM Alp or TM was added to the SKP cultures followed by western blot analysis targeting phosphorylated, activated ERK1/2. SKPs cultured in FGF2 and EGF exhibited basal levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation that increased approximately two-fold after treatment with Alp or TM ( FIGS. 8A and 8B ). In contrast, neither Alp nor TM increased the phosphorylated, activated forms of STAT3, GSK3beta, Akt1, or CREB compared to control ( FIG. 8C ). 
     To assess whether MEK-ERK activity was important for SKPs self-renewal, the highly selective MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib (GSK1120212) was used as described in Gilmartin et al., Clin. Cancer Res. 17: 989-1000, 2011. Trametinib was first shown to inhibit basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation in cultured SKPs ( FIG. 8D ). A methylcellulose colony formation assay was then used to determine the importance of MEK-ERK activity for SKPs self-renewal, and trametinib was shown to decrease both the number and size of clonal spheres grown in FGF2 and EGF ( FIGS. 8E and 8F ). MEK inhibition also decreased SKPs proliferation, but not survival, as monitored by Ki67 immunostaining of SKP spheres cultured for 48 hours with or without trametinib ( FIGS. 8G-8H ). 
     Three separate lines of evidence indicated that MEK-ERK activity was also important for drug-induced self-renewal. First, trametinib suppressed the ability of Alp and TM to increase ERK1/2 phosphorylation in SKPs cultured for 24 hours ( FIG. 8I ). Second, inhibition of MEK with 100 nM trametinib in 7 day sphere assays resulted in a robust decrease in sphere number, and neither TM nor Alp compensated for this decrease ( FIG. 8J ).

     In One aspect, the determination of an enzyme deficiency may be made using a test for fecal chymotrypsin levels. Methods such as PCR or other amplification, SNP detection, sequencing, and/or DNA combing may be used to detect the presence of a mutation or presence of short RNA sequences which interfere with expression of one or more genes encoding a digestive enzyme. For example, the mutation may in a gene encoding a digestive enzyme which decreases or eliminates the activity of the enzyme. As another example, the mutation may be mutation in the MET gene, a gene encoding the pleiotropic MET receptor tyrosine kinase See Campbell et al., PNAS 103(46), 16834-39 (2006). These mutations may include, for example, the MET promoter variant rs1858830 C allele, and or mutations in the MET signaling pathway such as a haplotype of the SERPINE1 gene, or the rs 344781 PLAUR promoter variant T allele.

The patent in question is titled Auto-recognizing therapeutic RNA/DNA chimeric nanoparticles (NP).  The extract of text citing that article is: inclusion of ribozyme sequences within antisense RNAs confers RNA-cleaving activity upon them, thereby increasing the activity of the constructs. The design and use of target RNA-specific ribozymes is described in Haseloff et al., Nature 334:585-591. 1988, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0003469 A1, each of which is incorporated by reference. 
     Accordingly, the disclosure also features a catalytic RNA molecule that includes, in the binding arm, an antisense RNA having between eight and nineteen consecutive nucleobases. In preferred embodiments of this disclosure, the catalytic nucleic acid molecule is formed in a hammerhead or hairpin motif. Examples of such hammerhead motifs are described by Rossi et al., Aids Research and Human Retroviruses, 8:183, 1992. Example of hairpin motifs are described by Hampel et al., â€œRNA Catalyst for Cleaving Specific RNA Sequences,â€ filed Sep. 20, 1989, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 07/247,100 filed Sep. 20, 1988, Hampel and Tritz, Biochemistry, 28:4929, 1989, and Hampel et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 18: 299, 1990. These specific motifs are not limiting in the disclosure and those skilled in the art will recognize that all that is important in an enzymatic nucleic acid molecule of this disclosure is that it has a specific substrate binding site which is complementary to one or more of the target gene RNA regions, and that it have nucleotide sequences within or surrounding that substrate binding site which impart an RNA cleaving activity to the molecule. 
     Small hairpin RNAs consist of a stem-loop structure with optional 3â€² UU-overhangs. While there may be variation, stems can range from 21 to 31 bp (desirably 25 to 29 bp), and the loops can range from 4 to 30 bp (desirably 4 to 23 bp). For expression of shRNAs within cells, plasmid vectors containing either the polymerase III H1-RNA or U6 promoter, a cloning site for the stem-looped RNA insert, and a 4-5-thymidine transcription termination signal can be employed. The Polymerase III promoters generally have well-defined initiation and stop s",0.96

The patent in question is titled Metastasis specific splice variants of Mena and uses thereof in diagnosis prognosis and treatment of tumors.  The extract of text citing that article is: mily of proteins. These proteins are regulatory molecules which control cell movement, motility and shape in a number of cell types and organisms. They are proposed to function by preventing the actin filaments from being capped by capping proteins at their barbed ends (Barzik et al., 2005). The anti-capping activity of Mena has been proposed to amplify the barbed end output of the cofilin and Arp2/3 complex pathways, which is sufficient to increase metastatic potential in mammary tumors (Wang et al., 2006). Ena/VASP proteins are also constituents of the adherence junctions necessary to seal membranes in the epithelial sheet and control actin organization on cadherin adhesion contact (Scott et al., 2006). This process is frequently perturbed in cancer. Ena/VASP proteins contain specific domains including the N-terminal EVH1 domain, which plays an essential role in intracellular protein localization by interacting with proline-rich motifs found in proteins such like zyxin and vinculin (Prehoda et al., 1999). The proline-rich domain in the center is known to mediate interaction with proteins having the SH3 and WW domains and also with the actin monomer binding protein profilin (Gertler et la., 1996). The C-terminal domain of Mena contains an EVH2 domain that is involved in tetramerization of the protein and also binding to G- and F-actin (Kuhnel et al., 2004). The interaction of the EVH2 domain with the growing ends of the actin filaments is essential for targeting the Ena/VASP to lamellipodia and filopodia (Loureiro et al., 2002). Mena is upregulated in mouse and rat invasive breast cancer cells (Wang et al., 2004) and overexpressed in human breast cancer tissues (Di Modugno et al., 2004). Both mouse and human Mena homologs have been cloned and sequenced, and a number of splice variants have been identified (Gertler et al., 1996; Urbanelli et al., 2006). 
     Recently it has been shown that splice variants can work very efficiently as cancer biomarkers (Brinkman 2004; Venables 2006). H",0.97

     FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
     Disclosed herein are polynucleotide molecules for regulating genes in plants and methods of making and using such molecules. 
     BACKGROUND 
     The failure of herbicides to control resistant weeds is a problem especially when such weeds are growing in field of herbicide resistant crops that may have lower herbicide resistance than the weed. Herbicide-resistant weeds are identified with a variety of modes of action. Resistance resulting from selection for multiple copies of genes producing herbicide targeted proteins in pigweed is reported by Gaines et al. (2010)  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,  107(3): 1029-1034. Resistance resulting from mutations in genes producing herbicide targeted proteins in goosegrass, prickly lettuce, and ryegrass are reported by Baerson et al. (2002)  Plant Physiol.,  129(3):1265-1275; Preston et al. (2006)  Pesticide Biochem. Physiol.,  84(3):227-235; and Wakelin et al. (2006)  Weed Res . (Oxford), 46(5):432-440. Vacuolar sequestration of glyphosate is an observed mechanism in glyphosate resistant horseweed; see Ge et al. (2010)  Pest Management Sci.,  66:576-576. Resistance resulting from expression of enzymes that metabolize herbicides to an inactive chemical form in hairy crabgrass is reported by Hidayat et al. (1997)  Pesticide Biochem. Physiol.,  57(2): 137-146. Reddy et al. (2008)  J. Agric. Food Chem.,  56(6):2125-2130 reported the accumulation of aminomethylphosphonic acid in plant species treated with glyphosate.

     Because transcription factors recognize their relatively short binding sequences, even in the absence of surrounding genomic DNA, short oligonucleotides bearing the consensus binding sequence of a specific transcription factor can be used as tools for manipulating gene expression in living cells. This strategy involves the intracellular delivery of such â€œdecoy oligonucleotidesâ€, which are then recognized and bound by the target factor. Occupation of the transcription factor&#39;s DNA-binding site by the decoy renders the transcription factor incapable of subsequently binding to the promoter regions of target genes. Decoys can be used as therapeutic agents, either to inhibit the expression of genes that are activated by a transcription factor, or to up-regulate genes that are suppressed by the binding of a transcription factor. Examples of the utilization of decoy oligonucleotides can be found in Mann et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2000, 106: 1071-1075, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety. 
     The terms â€œantimirâ€ â€œmicroRNA inhibitorâ€ or â€œmiR inhibitorâ€ are synonymous and refer to oligonucleotides that interfere with the activity of specific miRNAs Inhibitors can adopt a variety of configurations including single stranded, double stranded (RNA/RNA or RNA/DNA duplexes), and hairpin designs, in general, microRNA inhibitors comprise one or more sequences or portions of sequences that are complementary or partially complementary with the mature strand (or strands) of the miRNA to be targeted, in addition, the miRNA inhibitor can also comprise additional sequences located 5â€² and 3â€² to the sequence that is the reverse complement of the mature miRNA. The additional sequences can be the reverse complements of the sequences that are adjacent to the mature miRNA in the pri-miRNA from which the mature miRNA is derived, or the additional sequences can be arbitrary sequences (having a mixture of ",0.99

     The Syk inhibitor fostamatinib was proposed as a therapy for B-cell malignancies on the basis of targeting Syk kinase (Sharman et al.,  J Clin Oncol.  2007; 25(suppl 18S)). Response rate to fostamatinib was reported as 54.5% based upon six subjects experiencing a partial lymph-node reduction of at least 50%. Unfortunately, fostamatinib treatment was associated with a relatively brief overall progression-free survival (PFS) of 18 weeks seen among participants treated in the phase 2 portion of the study, and PFS was 6.4 months for 11 subjects with CLL/SLL (Friedberg et al.,  Blood.  2010; 115(13):2578-2585). Further clinical development of fostamatinib has not been reported, and dose-limiting adverse events (AEs) possibly resulting from off-target activity of the agent highlight the need for more Syk-selective agents. 
     What is desired are methods for treating diseases responsive to the inhibition of Syk in subjects in need of such treatment, including in subjects who may be considered at risk for the disease, are refractory to standard treatments, and/or are in relapse after standard treatments, including those subjects with genomic aberrations that may be associated with resistance to treatments.

     Generally speaking the hydrophobic region is the part that contains the absorbing segment, which is the segment or function of the dispersant interacting with the pigment surface to effect dispersion. The hydrophilic segment is the segment that provides the stability of dispersion by interaction in the solute mixture to provide stabilization. This stabilization is characterized as steric stabilization or ionic stabilization. These phenomena were described by H. Spinelli in Adv. Mater, 1998, 10, no. 15, page 1215 to 1218. The ionically stabilized polymeric dispersants described above have little if any steric stabilization. 
     The polymeric dispersant can be neutralized prior to the start of the dispersion process. That is, the initial mixture of solvent blend and polymer dispersant has an appropriate amount of neutralizing agent. Alternatively, the neutralizing agent may be added with the polar solvent during the dispersing process. An additional option is to have the polymeric dispersant partially neutralized in the initial mixture and add additional neutralizing agent in the polar solvent. The amount of neutralization of the polymeric dispersant in the final mixture is up to about 100% neutralized, and preferably up to about 90% neutralized. 
     The neutralizing agent can be hydroxides of the alkali metals, amines and the like. Examples of neutralizing agents include organic bases such as mono-, di, tri-methylamine, morpholine, n-methyl morpholine; alcohol amines",0.38

The patent in question is titled Macrocyclic inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 and CD80(B7-1)/PD-L1 protein/protein interactions.  The extract of text citing that article is: Viruses (HPV), Hepatitis Viruses (HBV and HCV) and Kaposi&#39;s Herpes Sarcoma Virus (KHSV). Another form of tumor specific antigen which may be used in conjunction with PD-L1 blockade is purified heat shock proteins (HSP) isolated from the tumor tissue itself. These heat shock proteins contain fragments of proteins from the tumor cells and these HSPs are highly efficient at delivery to antigen presenting cells for eliciting tumor immunity (Suot, R. et al.,  Science,  269:1585-1588 (1995); Tamura, Y. et al.,  Science,  278:117-120 (1997)). 
     Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen presenting cells that can be used to prime antigen-specific responses. DC&#39;s can be produced ex vivo and loaded with various protein and peptide antigens as well as tumor cell extracts (Nestle, F. et al.,  Nat. Med.,  4:328-332 (1998)). DCs may also be transduced by genetic means to express these tumor antigens as well. DCs have also been fused directly to tumor cells for the purposes of immunization (Kugler, A. et al.,  Nat. Med.,  6:332-336 (2000)). As a method of vaccination, DC immunization may be effectively combined with PD-L1 blockade to activate more potent anti-tumor responses. 
     PD-L1 blockade may also be combined with standard cancer treatments. PD-L1 blockade may be effectively combined with chemotherapeutic regimes. In these instances, it may be possible to reduce the dose of chemotherapeutic reagent administered (Mokyr, M. et al.,  Cancer Res.,  58:5301-5304 (1998)). An example of such a combination is a macrocyclic peptide in combination with decarbazine for the treatment of melanoma. Another example of such a combination is a macrocyclic peptide in combination with interleukin-2 (IL-2) for the treatment of melanoma. The scientific rationale behind the combined use of PD-L1 blockade and chemotherapy is that cell death, that is a consequence of the cytotoxic action of most chemotherapeutic compounds, should result in increased levels of tumor antigen in the antigen presentation pathway.

The patent in question is titled Methods to protect against and treat multiple sclerosis.  The extract of text citing that article is: ty, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each V H  and V L  is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. â€œInactivating antibodiesâ€ refers to antibodies that do not induce the complement system. 
     The term â€œhypervariable region,â€ â€œHVR,â€ or â€œHV,â€ when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody-variable domain that are hypervariable in sequence and/or form structurally defined loops. Generally, antibodies comprise six HVRs; three in the V H  (H1, H2, H3), and three in the V L  (L1, L2, L3). In native antibodies, H3 and L3 display the most diversity of the six HVRs, and H3 in particular is believed to play a unique role in conferring fine specificity to antibodies. See, e.g., Xu et al. Immunity 13:37-45 (2000); Johnson and Wu in Methods in Molecular Biology 248:1-25 (Lo, ed., Human Press, Totowa, N. J., 2003). Indeed, naturally occurring camelid antibodies consisting of a heavy chain only are functional and stable in the absence of light chain. See, e.g., Hamers-Casterman et al., Nature 363:446-448 (1993) and Sheriff et al., Nature Struct. Biol. 3:733-736 (1996). 
     â€œFrameworkâ€ or â€œFRâ€ residues are those variable-domain residues other than the HVR residues as herein defined. The term â€œFc regionâ€ is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain, including native-sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions. Although the boundaries of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain might vary, the human IgG heavy-chain Fc region is usually defined to stretch from an amino acid residue at position Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus thereof. The C-terminal lysine (residue 447 according to the EU numbering system) of the Fc region may be removed, for example,",0.87

     The PA63 heptamer is also able to bind EF. The combination of PA+EF, named edema toxin, disables phagocytes and probably other cells, due to the intracellular adenylate cyclase activity of EF (see, Klimpel et al.,  Mol. Microbiol.  13:1094-1100 (1994); Leppla et al., Bacterial Protein Toxins, p. 111-112 (1988) Gustav Fischer, New York, N.Y.; Leppla  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA.,  79:3162-3166 (1982)). 
     LF and EF have substantial sequence homology in amino acid (aa) 1-250, and a mutagenesis study showed this region constitutes the PA-binding domain (Leppla (1995) Anthrax toxins,  Handb. Nat. Toxins  8:543-572; Quinn et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.,  166:20124-20130 (1991)). Systematic deletion of LF fusion proteins containing the catalytic domain of  Pseudomonas  exotoxin A established that LF aa 1-254 (LFn) are sufficient to achieve translocation of â€œpassengerâ€ polypeptides to the cytosol of cells in a PA-dependent process (see Arora et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.  267:15542-15548 (1992); Arora et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.  268:3334-3341 (1993)). Accordingly, the term â€œLFnâ€, as used herein, refers to a fragment of LF that retains the ability to bind PA and comprising amino acids 1-254. A highly cytotoxic LFn fusion to the ADP-ribosylation domain of  Pseudomonas  exotoxin A, named FP59, has been developed (Arora et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.  268: 3334-3341 (1993)). When combined with PA, FP59 kills any cell type which contains receptors for PA by the mechanism of inhibition of initial protein synthesis through ADP ribosylating inactivation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2), whereas native LF is highly specific for macrophages (Leppla, Anthrax toxins,  Handb. Nat. Toxins  8:543-572 (1995)). For this reason, FP59 is an example of a potent therapeutic agent when specifically delivered to the target cells with a target-specific PA.

     Compound R01 is administered to knock-in mice homozygous for a (GAA) 230  repeat in the first intron of the endogenous frataxin gene (Miranda et al., 2002, FEBS Lett., 512:291-297). The mice are treated by subcutaneous daily injections with 150 mg/kg of compound or its equivalent of vehicle, for 3 consecutive days. Brain, heart, and skeletal muscle are recovered 24 hours after the last injection. Total RNA from brain stem, heart, and/or cerebellum is extracted. Frataxin mRNA expression is determined by one step quantitative real-time PCR using the primers 5â€²-CCTGGCCGAGTTCTTTGAAG-3â€² (SEQ ID NO:1) and 5â€²-GCCAGATTTGCTTGTTTGG-3â€² (SEQ ID NO:2). Frataxin mRNA is significantly lower in the brain, cerebellum and heart of vehicle-treated knock-in mice than in similarly treated wild-type animals. Treatment with compound R01 increases knock-in frataxin mRNA to levels that do not significantly differ from wild-type, thus demonstrating correction of fxn deficiency in these animals. Western blotting confirms that increased fxn mRNA levels result in higher frataxin protein level. Treatment with compound R01 does not result in increased frataxin mRNA l",0.99

Other housekeeping genes that have been used as internal standards in Northern analyses of gene expression may also be used. See, e.g., Devereux et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 12:387 (1984); Barbu et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 17:7115 (1989). In some embodiments, a competitive template for a reference nucleic acid may comprise a nucleic acid having a sequence similar to either strand of cDNA of a housekeeping gene, but having a distinguishable feature as described above. 
     Many different genes can provide reference nucleic acids. The choice of reference nucleic acid may depend on the tissues to be assayed and/or the biological states being studied. For example, Î²-actin varies little among different normal bronchial epithelial cell samples (see, e.g., Crawford, E. L., Khuder, S. A., Durham, S. J., et al. (2000) Normal bronchial epithelial cell expression of glutathione transferase P1, glutathione transferase M3, and glutathione peroxidase is low in subjects with bronchogenic carcinoma.

The patent in question is titled Combination therapies of EGFR inhibitors.  The extract of text citing that article is: nts are irreversible inhibitors that covalently bind to cysteine 797 at the EGFR ATP binding site with potent activity on both activating (L858R, ex19del) and acquired (T790M) EGFR mutations in pre-clinical models. However, their clinical efficacy has proven to be limited, possibly in part due to severe adverse effects caused by concomitant inhibition of wild-type (WT) EGFR. 
     To overcome the previous issues with the earlier generations of inhibitors, third-generation EGFR TKIs have been developed which are WT EGFR sparing but also have relative equal potency for activating EGFR (L858R and ex19del) and acquired (T790M) mutations. Third generation EFGR TKIs, such as AZD9291 (mereletinib) and CO-1686 (rociletinib), are beginning to enter clinical development and are showing significant initial promise (e.g., see â€œAZD9291 in EGFR Inhibitor-Resistant Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancerâ€, Hanne et al, N Engl J Med, 2015; 372; 1689-99 and â€œRociletinib in EGFR-Mutated Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancerâ€, Sequist et al, J Med, 2015; 372; 1700-9). See also â€œASP8273, a novel mutant-selective irreversible EGFR inhibitor, inhibits growth of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with EGFR activating and T790M resistance mutationsâ€, Sakagami et al, AACR; Cancer Res 2014; 74; 1728. 
     Treatment with EGFR inhibitors has however, not been shown to definitively translate into prolonged overall survival and it is unlikely that even third generation inhibitors alone will suffice. Hence there is still a need for additional treatment options for patients with cancer and, in particular, solid tumors. There is also a need for additional treatment options for patients with lung cancer, such as NSCLC. One such method of boosting effectiveness of EGFR inhibitors in vivo is by dually targeting other proteins implicated in disease progression of NSCLC patients.

     The bispecific agents that specifically bind EGFR and c-Met of the invention may provide a benefit in terms of specificity and reduced off-target toxicity when compared to small molecule EGFR and/or c-Met inhibitors. The present invention is based at least in part on the surprising finding that the bispecific agents specifically binding EGFR and c-Met provide a significantly improved synergistic inhibitory effect when compared to a mixture of EGFR-binding and c-Met-binding monospecific agents. The molecules may be tailored to specific affinity towards both EGFR and c-Met to maximize tumor penetration and retention.

The patent in question is titled Fermentive production of four carbon alcohols.  The extract of text citing that article is:     Plasmid Expression of ilvC and bdhB Genes. Two remaining isobutanol genes, ilvC and bdhB, were expressed from a plasmid. Plasmid pHT01 (MoBitec), a  Bacillus - E. coli  shuttle vector, was used to fuse an ilvC gene from  B. subtilis  to a PgroE promoter so that the ilvC gene was expressed from the PgroE promoter containing a lacO sequence. The ilvC gene, given as SEQ ID NO:186, was PCR-amplified from  B. subtilis  BR151 (ATCC 33677) genomic DNA with primers T-ilvCB.s.(BamHI) (SEQ ID NO:150) and B-ilvCB.s.(SpeI BamHI) (SEQ ID NO:151). The 1,067 by ilvC PCR product was digested with BamHI and ligated into the BamHI site of pHT01. The ligation mixture was transformed into DH5Î± competent cells. Positive clones were screened for a 1,188 by PCR product by PCR amplification with primers T-groEL and B-ilvB.s.(SpeI BamHI). The positive clone was named pHT01-ilvC(B.$). Plasmid pHT01-ilvC(B.$) was used as a template for PCR amplification of the PgroE-ilvC fused fragment.

This plasmid was used for expression of ilvC and bdhB under the control of a PgroE promoter. To clone PgroE-ilvC, bdhB and a lacI repressor gene into plasmid pBD64, a one-step assembly method was used (Tsuge et al.,  Nucleic Acids Res.  31:e133 (2003)).

Such labeled polynucleotides are useful in a number of important contexts including as DNA sequencing primers, PCR primers, oligonucleotide hybridization probes, oligonucleotide ligation probes, and the like. 
     In some embodiments, labeled polynucleotides of the present teachings can include multiple dyes located such that fluorescence energy transfer takes place between a donor dye and an acceptor dye. Such multi-dye energy-transfer polynucleotides find application as spectrally-tunable sequencing primers, see for example, Ju, et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA  92: 4347-4351 (1995), or as hybridization probes, see for example, Lee, et al.  Nucleic Acids Research,  21: 3761-3766 (1993). 
     Labeled polynucleotides can be synthesized either enzymatically, e.g., using a DNA polymerase or ligase, see for example, Stryer,  Biochemistry , Chapter 24, W.H. Freeman and Company (1981), or by chemical synthesis, e.g., by the phosphoramidite method, the phosphitetriester method, and the like, see for example, Gait,  Oligonucleotide Synthesis , IRL Press (1990). Labels may be introduced during enzymatic synthesis utilizing labeled nucleotide triphosphate monomers as described above, or introduced during chemical synthesis using labeled non-nucleotide or nucleotide phosphoramidites as described above, or may be introduced subsequent to synthesis. 
     Generally, if the labeled polynucleotide is made using enzymatic synthesis, the following procedure can be used.

     1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
     This invention is directed to pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-based compounds useful as inhibitors of adaptor associated kinase 1 (AAK1), compositions comprising them, and methods of their use. 
     2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     Adaptor associated kinase 1 (AAK1) is a member of the Ark1/Prk1 family of serine/threonine kinases. AAK1 mRNA exists in two splice forms termed short and long. The long form predominates and is highly expressed in brain and heart (Henderson and Conner,  Mol. Biol. Cell.  2007, 18, 2698-2706). AAK1 is enriched in synaptosomal preparations and is co-localized with endocytic structures in cultured cells. AAK1 modulates clatherin coated endocytosis, a process that is important in synaptic vesicle recycling and receptor-mediated endocytosis. AAK1 associates with the AP2 complex, a hetero-tetramer which links receptor cargo to the clatherin coat. The binding of clatherin to AAK1 stimulates AAK1 kinase activity (Conner et. al.,  Traffic  2003, 4, 885-890; Jackson et. al.,  J. Cell. Biol.  2003, 163, 231-236). AAK1 phosphorylates the mu-2 subunit of AP-2, which promotes the binding of mu-2 to tyrosine containing sorting motifs on cargo receptors (Ricotta et. al.,  J. Cell Bio.  2002, 156, 791-795; Conner and Schmid,  J. Cell Bio.  2002, 156, 921-929). Mu2 phosphorylation is not required for receptor uptake, but phosphorylation enhances the efficiency of internalization (Motely et. al.,  Mol. Biol. Cell.  2006, 17, 5298-5308). 
     AAK1 has been identified as an i",0.25

     In another preferred aspect, the fermentation product is a gas. In another more preferred aspect, the gas is methane. In another more preferred aspect, the gas is H 2 . In another more preferred aspect, the gas is CO 2 . In another more preferred aspect, the gas is CO. See, for example, Kataoka, N., A. Miya, and K.

     Recovery. 
     The fermentation product(s) can be optionally recovered from the fermentation medium using any method known in the art including, but not limited to, chromatography, electrophoretic procedures, differential solubility, distillation, or extraction. For example, alcohol is separated from the fermented cellulosic material and purified by conventional methods of distillation.

The patent in question is titled Graphene supported artificial membranes and uses thereof.  The extract of text citing that article is: trand, pulling the double stranded DNA through the channel at a controlled rate. Thus, the exonuclease can operate as a pore as well as a motor for drawing the nucleic acid polymer through the channel. Exonuclease Lambda may also be excluded from the molecular motors employed in the invention. Additional exonucleases include, for example, T7 Exonuclease, Exo III, RecJ 1  Exonuclease, Exo I, and Exo T. 
     Another type of molecular motor is a helicase. Helicases are proteins, which move along polynucleotide backbones and unwind the polynucleotide so that the processes of DNA replication, repair, recombination, transcription, mRNA splicing, translation, and ribosomal assembly, can take place. Helicases include both RNA and DNA helicases. Helicases have previously been described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,792. Exemplary helicases include hexameric helicases such as the  E - coli  bacteriophage T7 gp4 and T4 gp41 gene proteins, and the  E. coli  proteins DnaB, RuvB, and rho (for review see: West S C,  Cell,  86, 177-180 (1996)). Hexameric helicases unwind double stranded DNA in a 5â€²-3â€² direction, which ensures a directional analysis of the DNA target molecules. In addition, some of the helicases have processive translocation rates in excess of 1000 nucleotides per second (Roman et al. J. Biol. Chem. 267:4207 (1992). In addition, these hexameric helicases form a ring structure having an inside hole dimension ranging in size from 2-4 nanometers and an outside ring dimension of about 14 nanometers, which is within the dimension limits of a useful molecular motor. The hexameric ring structure is formed and stabilized in the presence of Mg +2  and some type of nucleotide (NMP, NDP or NTP). 
     The intrinsic rate of movement of a particular molecular motor may be modified, e.g., by chemical modification of the motor, by changes in temperature, pH, ionic strength, the presence of necessary cofactors, substrates, inhibitors, agonists, or antagonists, by the nature of the medium (e.g., the presence of nonaqueous ",0.61

The patent in question is titled Physically modified extracellular matrix materials and uses thereof.  The extract of text citing that article is: tainable under light microscopic examination. Such non-collagenous solids can constitute a significant percentage of the dry weight of the ECM material in certain inventive embodiments, for example at least about 1%, at least about 3%, and at least about 5% by weight in various embodiments of the invention. 
     The submucosa or other ECM material used in the present invention may also exhibit an angiogenic character and thus be effective to induce angiogenesis in a host engrafted with the material. In this regard, angiogenesis is the process through which the body makes new blood vessels to generate increased blood supply to tissues. Thus, angiogenic materials, when contacted with host tissues, promote or encourage the formation of new blood vessels. Methods for measuring in vivo angiogenesis in response to biomaterial implantation have recently been developed. For example, one such method uses a subcutaneous implant model to determine the angiogenic character of a material. See, C. Heeschen et al., Nature Medicine 7 (2001), No. 7, 833-839. When combined with a fluorescence microangiography technique, this model can provide both quantitative and qualitative measures of angiogenesis into biomaterials. C. Johnson et al., Circulation Research 94 (2004), No. 2, 262-268. 
     As prepared and used, the submucosa material or any other ECM material may optionally retain and/or otherwise include growth factors or other bioactive components native to the source tissue. For example, the submucosa or other ECM material may retain one or more growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and/or platelet derived growth factor (PDGF).

     This application is a U.S. National Phase application under 35 U.S.C. Â§371 of PCT Application No. PCT/US2014/049537, filed Aug. 4, 2014, which claims priority from PCT/CN2013/081081, filed Aug. 8, 2013. 
     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     The orexins (hypocretins) comprise two neuropeptides produced in the hypothalamus: the orexin A (OX-A) (a 33 amino acid peptide) and the orexin B (OX-B) (a 28 amino acid peptide) (Sakurai T. et al., Cell, 1998, 92, 573-585). Orexins are found to stimulate food consumption in rats suggesting a physiological role for these peptides as mediators in the central feedback mechanism that regulates feeding behavior (Sakurai T. et al., Cell, 1998, 92, 573-585). Orexins regulate states of sleep and wakefulness opening potentially novel therapeutic approaches for narcoleptic or insomniac patients (Chemelli R. M. et al., Cell, 1999, 98, 437-451). Orexins have also been indicated as playing a role in arousal, reward, learning and memory (Harris, et al., Trends Neurosci., 2006, 29 (10), 571-577). Two orexin receptors have been cloned and characterized in mammals. They belong to the super family of G-protein coupled receptors (Sakurai T. et al., Cell, 1998, 92, 573-585): the orexin-1 receptor (OX or OX1R) is selective for OX-A and the orexin-2 receptor (OX2 or OX2R) is capable to bind OX-A as well as OX-B. The physiological actions in which orexins are presumed to participate are thought to be expressed via one or both of OX1 receptor and OX2 receptor as the two subtypes of orexin receptors.

The patent in question is titled Protein kinase C inhibitors and uses thereof.  The extract of text citing that article is: for immunosuppression in transplantation and autoimmune diseases (Isakov et al. (2002) Annual Review of Immunology, 20, 761-794). PCT Publication WO2004/043386 identifies PKC Î¸ as a target for treatment of transplant rejection and multiple sclerosis. PKC Î¸ also plays a role in inflammatory bowel disease (The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (2005), 313 (3), 962-982), asthma (WO 2005062918), and lupus (Current Drug Targets: Inflammation &amp; Allergy (2005), 4 (3), 295-298). 
     In addition, PKC Î¸ is highly expressed in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Blay, P. et al. (2004) Clinical Cancer Research, 10, 12, Pt. 1), it has been suggested that PKC Î¸ is a molecular target for treatment of gastrointestinal cancer (Wiedmann, M. et al. (2005) Current Cancer Drug Targets 5(3), 171). 
     Experiments induced in PKC Î¸ knock-out mice led to the conclusion that PKC Î¸ inactivation prevented fat-induced defects in insulin signalling and glucose transport in skeletal muscle (Kim J. et al, 2004, The J. of Clinical Investigation 114 (6), 823). This data indicates PKC Î¸ is a therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and hence PKC Î¸ inhibitors can be useful for treating such disease. 
     Therapeutic Applications 
     The subject compounds are useful for treating a disease or disorder that is mediated through, or exacerbated by, the activity of a PKC in a subject in need of treatment. Also, the compounds are useful for treating a disease or disorder that is associated with aberrant or otherwise undesirable T cell activation in a subject.

Serum specimens collected from an independent validation cohort collected as part the Pediatric Heart Network Study of Kawasaki disease. See Newburger et al., 356 New Engl. J. Med. 663 (2007). 
     For all study patients, urine was collected as clean-catch samples. Specimens were labeled with a study number such that all analysis was blinded. Specimens were stored at âˆ’80Â° C. within 6 hr of collection. Blood specimens for serum collection were clotted and centrifuged according to standard methods, with the serum stored at âˆ’80Â° C. within 30 min of collection. 
     The study was conducted at a tertiary care pediatric hospital and approved by the Children&#39;s Hospital Boston Committee on Clinical Investigation. Patients younger than 18 years of age who were being evaluated for possible KD were enrolled according to clinical history and physical examination. Eligible patients had at least 4 days of fever and either four or more principal clinical criteria for KD (Newburger et al., 110 Circulation 2747 (2004)), or a coronary artery z-score of 2.5 or more for the proximal right coronary artery or the left anterior descending coronary artery, as measured by two-dimensional echocardiography. In addition, patients with incomplete presentations of KD meeting only three diagnostic clinical criteria were enrolled based on expert opinion. Patients were excluded if they had pre-existing neoplastic, renal or urologic disease or were pregnant.

The patent in question is titled Reduction of migration shift assay interference.  The extract of text citing that article is:  sensitivity and/or accuracy of the migration shift analysis. 
     Non-specific binding has been a problem in studies of DNA binding proteins. This problem was addressed in Brehm, BBRC 63: 24-31, 1975, where an anion exchange resin (QAE-Sephadex) was used to adsorb negatively charged blood serum proteins while washing away positively charged proteins that could non-specifically bind to the negatively charged DNA molecule. Adsorbed proteins were eluted from the QAE-Sephadex then applied to DNA-cellulose. 
     Proteins that bound to the DNA cellulose were identified as DNA binding proteins. Although this technique may have washed away some positively charged proteins that would have bound non-specifically to the DNA-cellulose, some of the proteins washed away were probably unidentified DNA binding proteins. 
     Instead of removing all positively charged proteins before a DNA binding assay, polyanion blocking agents can be added to assay solutions to minimize non-specific binding. In Carthew, et al., Cell 43: 439-448, 1985, poly dIdC was added to running buffers of a DNA binding gel electrophoresis migration shift assay to reduce the effect of proteins that bind non-specifically to the DNA. In such a strategy, poly-dIdC can compete with the target DNA for the non-specific DNA binding molecules, thereby reducing non-specific binding interference while enhancing the migration shift signal of any specifically bound proteins. Theoretically, DNA binding proteins specific for the target DNA can be detected, even if they are positively charged, since they can bind stronger to the target DNA, having both electrostatic and specific binding affinities. Although this blocking technology provides one way to enhance detection of DNA binding proteins, it fails to describe methods to enhance detection of migration shifts resulting from other types of specific binding interactions. 
     Migration shifts can be observed in other interactions of affinity molecules with analytes. Migration shifts can be observed, for exa",0.68

Eukaryotic expression systems for mammalian cells, yeast, and insect cells are well known by those of skill in the art and are also commercially available. 
     The particular expression vector used to transport the genetic material into the cell is selected with regard to the intended use of the fusion proteins, e.g., expression in plants, animals, bacteria, fungus, protozoa, etc. (see expression vectors described below). Standard bacterial and animal expression vectors are known in the art and are described in detail, for example, U.S. Patent Publication 20050064474A1 and International Patent Publications WO05/084190, WO05/014791 and WO03/080809.

In third-generation sequencing, a slide with an aluminum coating with many small (Ëœ50 nm) holes is used as a zero mode waveguide (see, e.g., Levene et al., Science 299, 682-686 (2003)). The aluminum surface is protected from attachment of DNA polymerase by polyphosphonate chemistry, e.g., polyvinylphosphonate chemistry (see, e.g., Korlach et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 105, 1176-1181 (2008)). This results in preferential attachment of the DNA polymerase molecules to the exposed silica in the holes of the aluminum coating. This setup allows evanescent wave phenomena to be used to reduce fluorescence background, allowing the use of higher concentrations of fluorescently labeled dNTPs. The fluorophore is attached to the terminal phosphate of the dNTPs, such that fluorescence is released upon incorporation of the dNTP, but the fluorophore does not remain attached to the newly incorporated nucleotide, meaning that the complex is immediately ready for another round of incorporation. By this method, incorporation of dNTPs into an individual primer-template complexes present in the holes of the aluminum coating can be detected. See, e.g., Eid et al., Science 323, 133-138 (2009).

     FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
     The present invention relates to inhibitors of human immunoproteasomes. 
     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     The proteasome is a large, ATP-dependent, multi-subunit, barrel-shaped N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase present in the cytosol and nucleus of eukaryotic cells, and is responsible for the degradation of the majority of cellular proteins (Baumeister et al., â€œThe Proteasome: Paradigm of a Self-Compartmentalizing Protease,â€  Cell  92:367-380 (1998); Goldberg, A. L., â€œFunctions of the Proteasome: From Protein Degradation and Immune Surveillance to Cancer Therapy,â€  Biochemical Society Transactions  35:12-17 (2007)). The proteasome not only controls many critical cellular checkpoints through degradation, but also generates peptides for antigen presentation (Goldberg, A. L., â€œFunctions of the Proteasome: From Protein Degradation and Immune Surveillance to Cancer Therapy,â€  Biochemical Society Transactions  35:12-17 (2007); Rock et al., â€œInhibitors of the Proteasome Block the Degradation of Most Cell Proteins and the Generation of Peptides Presented on MHC Class I Molecules,â€  Cell  78:761-771 (1994)). Highly specific proteasome inhibitors can markedly limit the overall supply of peptides for MHC class I molecules and thus block antigen presentation (Rock et al., â€œProtein Degradation and the Generation of MHC Class I-Presented Peptides,â€  Advances in Immunology  80:1-70 (2002)). The constitutive proteasome core particle is called 2",0.01

The patent in question is titled Dipeptides as inhibitors of human immunoproteasomes.  The extract of text citing that article is: e inhibitors were determined using a cell-based Proteasome-Gloâ„¢ assay (Promega, Cat. No. G8660) to measure the proteasome activity inside the cells after removal of compound from the medium (Table 4 and  FIG. 5B ). 
     Example 153â€”DPLG-3 Induces Autophagy 
     RAW264 GFP-LC3 cells were incubated with vehicle DMSO control, DPLG-3 (10 nM), or the inactive congener DPLG-2032 (l Î¼M) at 37Â° C. overnight. Prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, the cells were treated with bafilomycin A (20 nM), an inhibitor of the late phase of autophagy, for 4 hours. The fluorescent images taken of these different sample treatments ( FIGS. 7A-C ) indicated that the DPLG-3 induces autophagy. 
     Autophagy is a highly conserved process in eukaryotic cells that degrades a large proportion of cytosolic proteins and organelles. It involves the formation of double membrane complexes that fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, where engulfed proteins or organelles are degraded by lysosomal proteases (Fleming et al., â€œChemical Modulators of Autophagy as Biological Probes and Potential Therapeutics,â€  Nature Chemical Biology  7:9-17 (2011), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Stresses such as nutrient starvation, hypoxia, protein aggregates, ER stress, pathogens, and DNA damage induce autophagy (Kroemer et al., â€œAutophagy and the Integrated Stress Response,â€  Mol. Cell  40:280-293 (2010), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). 
     Autophagy plays critical roles in many physiological and patho-physiological processes. It has been shown that pharmacological induction of autophagy in mice with rapamycin increases the lifespan of the mice (Harrison et al., â€œRapamycin Fel Latee in Life Extends Lifespan in Genetically Heterogeneous Mice,â€  Nature  460:392-395 (2009), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Autophagy has also been demonstrated to protect against infectious diseases, such as infections caused by the bacteria  Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica, Shigella flexneri, Listeria monocytogenes , etc. and parasites such as  Toxoplasma gondi",0.85

The patent in question is titled Methods and compositions for treating genetically linked diseases of the eye.  The extract of text citing that article is:  at least 98% or at least 99% sequence identity to a full-length human retinoschisin protein (SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:5), or any portion thereof, that has at least one activity of a wild-type retinoschisin protein. Known functions of the retinoschisin protein include binding to anionic phospholipids, binding to the sterile alpha and TIR motif-containing protein (SARM1), binding to alpha-B crystalline protein and binding to beta2 laminin. 
     As noted above, the retinoschisin protein comprises a discoidin domain, a structure that has been found in other secreted and transmembrane proteins. While the function of the discoidin domain in the retinoschisin protein is not well understood, in other proteins it has been implicated in cell-cell adhesion and cell-cell signaling. With regard to retinoschisin, it has been demonstrated that introduction of mutations that alter the discoidin domain structure result in loss of retinoschisin function and development of x-linked retinoschisis (see, Wu and Molay, J. Biol. Chem., 278(30):28139-28146, 2003, which is incorporated herein by reference).

The patent in question is titled Method of conferring a protective immune response to Norovirus.  The extract of text citing that article is: 3, 1994) evaluated a subset of these sera for IgG and IgA by ELISA and observed Norwalk IgG peak titers of approximately 15,900 from days 15 to 90 and IgA peak titers of approximately 12,600 from days 24 and 90. A comparison of IgG and IgA between challenged and vaccinated subjects is planned. 
     These results show for the first time the presence of circulating Norwalk-specific IgA and IgG ASC following intranasal vaccination with adjuvanted VLP. Hence, it was important to study the homing characteristics of these effector cells. It is widely accepted that CD62L is a key molecule implicated in the initial phase of migration through high endothelial venules (HEV) in lymphoid tissues, including lymph nodes and Peyer&#39;s Patches, through binding to the peripheral lymph node addressins (PNad) and the mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM-1) present in the HEV vascular endothelium, which results in tethering and rolling (Brandtzaeg et al. (2005) Immunol Rev, Vol. 206:32-63; Bargatze et al. (1995) Immunity, Vol. 3:99-108; and Shyjan et al. (1996) J. Immunol., Vol. 156:2851-7). In contrast, at mucosal effector sites, although a number of adhesion molecules are involved, vascular adhesion specificity is mediated by integrin Î±4/Î²7 interacting with the MAdCAM-1 addressin (Brandtzaeg et al. (2005) Immunol Rev, Vol. 206:32-63; Bargatze et al. (1995) Immunity, Vol. 3:99-108; and Shyjan et al. (1996) J. Immunol., Vol. 156:2851-7). Thus, cells expressing integrin Î±4/Î²7, but not CD62L, are destined to home to the gut mucosa, whilst cells expressing CD62L, but not integrin Î±4/Î²7, are destined to home to peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes. As an example, a previous study evaluating B cell surface markers in response to acute rotavirus infections showed that cells homing to the gut mucosa were CD27+ integrin Î±4/Î²7+ CD62L+/âˆ’ (Jaimes et al.

The extract of text citing that article is: ptides, soluble receptors, adnectins, small peptides, peptide mimetics, small molecules, aptamers, etc., that specifically bind to the Fc-region of an immunoglobulin. Specific examples of Fc-binding molecules include Protein A, Protein G, Protein A/G fusion proteins, Protein L, and fragments and variants thereof which retain the ability to specifically bind to the Fc region of an antibody. 
     Protein A is a 40-60 kDa MSCRAMM (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) surface protein found in the cell wall of  Staphylococcus aureus , and is encoded by the spa gene. Wild-type Protein A is composed of five homologous Ig-binding domains that fold into a three-helix bundle, and which can individually bind to the Fc regions of an antibody. Protein A binds with high affinity to human IgG1 and IgG2 and with moderate affinity to human IgM, IgA and IgE. 
     Protein G is an immunoglobulin-binding protein expressed in group C and G Streptococcal bacteria (see, e.g., Sjobring et al.,  J Biol Chem.  266: 399-405, 1991). The NMR solution structure (see Lian et al.,  Journal of Mol. Biol.  228:1219-1234, 1992) and the crystal structure (see Derrick and Wigley,  Journal of Mol.

     A non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul, 1990, PNAS 87:2264-2268, modified as in Karlin and Altschul, 1993, PNAS. 90:5873-5877. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul et al., 1990, J. Mol. Biol. 215:403. BLAST nucleotide searches are performed with the NBLAST nucleotide program parameters set, e.g., for score=100, word length=12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecules of the present invention. BLAST protein searches are performed with the XBLAST program parameters set, e.g., to score 50, word length=3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein molecule of the present invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST are utilized as described in Altschul et al., 1997, Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402. Alternatively, PSI BLAST is used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between molecules. When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, and PSI Blast programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., of XBLAST and NBLAST) are used. Another preferred, non limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller, 1988, CABIOS 4:11-17. Such an algorithm is incorporated in the ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences, a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 is used. 
     The percent identity between two sequences is determined using techniques similar to those described above, with or without allowing gaps. In calculating percent identity, typically only exact matches are counted.

The patent in question is titled Methods and systems for content processing.  The extract of text citing that article is: requency/improbability of the person-related metadata associated with the image. 
     While analysis of metadata gives useful information about whether an image is person-centric, other techniques can also be employedâ€”either alternatively, or in conjunction with metadata analysis. 
     One technique is to analyze the image looking for continuous areas of skin-tone colors. Such features characterize many features of person-centric images, but are less frequently found in images of places and things. 
     A related technique is facial recognition. This science has advanced to the point where even inexpensive point-and-shoot digital cameras can quickly and reliably identify faces within an image frame (e.g., to focus or expose the image based on such subjects). 
     (Face finding technology is detailed, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,781,650 (Univ. of Central Florida), U.S. Pat. No. 6,633,655 (Sharp), U.S. Pat. No. 6,597,801 (Hewlett-Packard) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,430,306 (L-1 Corp.), and in Yang et al, Detecting Faces in Images: A Survey, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Vol. 24, No. 1, January 2002, pp. 34-58, and Zhao, et al, Face Recognition: A Literature Survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 2003, pp. 399-458. Additional papers about facial recognition technologies are noted in a bibliography at the end of the provisional specification to which this application claims priority.) 
     Facial recognition algorithms can be applied to the set of reference images obtained from Flickr, to identify those that have evident faces, and identify the portions of the images corresponding to the faces. 
     Of course, many photos have faces depicted incidentally within the image frame. While all images having faces could be identified as person-centric, most embodiments employ further processing to provide a more refined assessment. 
     One form of further processing is to determine the percentage area of the image frame occupied by the identified face(s). The higher the percentage, the higher the likelihood that the image is person-centric. This is another metric than can be used in determin",0.9

     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     Wound healing is a carefully orchestrated series of events with overlapping temporal and spatial relationships, and includes phases of inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling (Guo et al.,  Journal Dent Res,  89:219-229 (2010); Shih et al.,  Wound Repair Regeneration,  18:139-153 (2010)). Some of the processes in wound repair that have been implicated as responsible factors include abnormalities in inflammation, migration, angiogenesis, neovascularization, cell proliferation, formation of granulation tissue and collagen, and re-epithelialization (Usui et al.,  Journal of Histochem Cytochem,  56:687-696 (2008); Mustoe et al,  American Journal of Surgery,  187:655-705 (2004); Brem et al.,  Arch Surg,  135:627-634 (2000)). 
     In Type 1 diabetes, wounds often fail to progress through the normal stages of healing (Boulton et al.,  Lancet,  366:1719-1724 (2005); Usui et al.,  Journal of Histochem Cytochem,  56:687-696 (2008)). Impaired wound healing is a major complication of diabetes that can result in the formation of chronic debilitating ulcers (Guo et al.,  Journal Dent Res,  89:219-229 (2010); Boulton et al.,  Lancet,  366:1719-1724 (2005); O&#39;Loughlin et al.,  International Journal of Lower Extremity Wounds,  9:90-102 (2010)). Diabetes is the leading cause of amputations (Boulton et al.,  Lancet,  366:1719-1724 (2005); O&#39;Loughlin et al.,  International Journal of Lower Extremity Wounds,  9:90-102 (2010)), accounting for over 50% of patients having lower extremity amputations annually. With the number of diabetic patients estimated to reach 300 million world-wide by the year 2030, the burden of diabetic wounds and their complications is expected to rise simultaneously (Boulton et al.,  Lancet,  366:1719-1724 (2005)).

     Nitrogen-heterocyclic carbenes also can be used as catalysts in the polymerization methods described herein.  FIG. 3  illustrates the preparation of nitrogen-heterocyclic carbenes from salt and zwitterion intermediates (Panel A), as well as some heterocyclic carbene classes (Panel B, which illustrates an imidazole-2-ylidene, a 1,2,4-triazole-5-ylidene, a thiazole-2-ylidene, and an imidazolin-2-ylidene). A representative carbene is 1,3-(di-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-ylidene. These carbene bases and their preparation are described in detail by Enders et al.,  Chem. Rev.  2007, 107:5606-5655, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The reaction of monomers 2a and 2c with the zwitterionic carboxylate precursor of 1,3-(di-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-ylidene (see  FIG. 3 ) releases CO 2  upon heating and produces the active catalyst in situ. On a 2 mmol scale, the GPC M n  of the resulting polymer was 56,000 Da (polystyrene standards), and the PDI was 1.4. 
     The mechanism of the catalysis is not yet understood. Preliminary investigations suggest that activation of silyl ethers with F âˆ’ /F 2   âˆ’  and their conversion to hypervalent silicon derivatives, may possibly be at least partially responsible for the observed reactivity of the silyl ethers with fluorosulfates. Interactions of DBU and similar catalysts with the fluorosulfonyl group may also or alternatively play a role in the reaction.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS 
     Real-time detection of cancer cells during surgical tumor resection is a critical unmet need. Imaging agents described herein have characteristics that distinguish them from other imaging technologies. For instance, most optical imaging agents are aimed at near-infrared wavelengths above 700 nm to ensure that the detection is deep in the body. However, the technology provided herein is directed at diseased cells (e.g., residual cancer cells in the tumor bed) at or near the surface, and deep tissue detection is not the goal.

In some embodiments, a provided compound does not emit fluorescence as the dark quencher absorbs emitted fluorescence from the fluorophore. Once cathepsins cleave a provided compound at the amino acid backbone, the Cy5 fluorophore emits detectable fluorescence. This technology is applicable to cancers at various anatomical sites (e.g., sarcoma and breast cancer) because the compound is activated by the family of cathepsin enzymes, which are upregulated in many types of cancer.

     Methods for synthesizing somatostatin peptides and analogs are well documented and are within the ability of a person of ordinary skill in the art as exemplified in the references listed supra. Further synthetic procedures are provided in the following examples. The following examples also illustrate methods for synthesizing the targeted cytotoxic compounds of the present invention. Specific targeting of therapeutic or cytotoxic agents allows selective destruction of a tumor expressing a receptor specific for a biologically active peptide. For example, a tumor expressing a somatostatin receptor includes a neoplasm of the lung, breast, prostate, colon, brain, gastrointestinal tract, neuroendocrine axis, liver, or kidney (see Schaer et al., Int. J. Cancer, 70:530-537, 1997; Chave et al., Br. J. Cancer 82(1):124-130, 2000; Evans et al., Br. J. Cancer 75(6):798-803, 1997). 
     In some embodiments, the targeting moiety has therapeutic features, e.g., the targeting moiety is cytotoxic or anti-angiogenic. In some embodiments, a targeting moiety has some increased affinity for tumor vasculature, or angiogenic blood vessels, e.g., those that over-express somatostatin receptors (see Denzler and Reubi, Cancer 85:188-198, 1999; Gulec et al., J. Surg. Res. 97(2):131-137, 2001; Woltering et al., J. Surg. Res. 50:245, 1991). 
     In some embodiments, the targeting moiety, e.g., somatostatin analog, used in the invention is hydrophilic, and is therefore water soluble. In some embodiments, such conjugates and particles containing such conjugates are used in treatment paradigms in which this feature is useful, e.g., compared to conjugates comprising hydrophobic analogs. Hydrophilic analogs described herein can be soluble in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and other bodily fluids, as well as in urine, which may facilitate excretion by the kidneys.

The patent in question is titled Antibodies directed against programmed death-1 (PD-1).  The extract of text citing that article is: t al.,  Cancer Res.,  64: 1140-1145 (2004)). PD-1 knockout mice are resistant to tumor challenge (Iwai et al.,  Int. Immunol.,  17: 133-144 (2005)), and T-cells from PD-1 knockout mice are highly effective in tumor rejection when adoptively transferred to tumor-bearing mice (Blank et al., supra). Blocking PD-1 inhibitory signals using a monoclonal antibody can potentiate host anti-tumor immunity in mice (Iwai et al., supra; and Hirano et al.,  Cancer Res.,  65: 1089-1096 (2005)), and high levels of PD-L1 expression in tumors are associated with poor prognosis for many human cancer types (Hamanishi et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,  104: 3360-335 (2007), Brown et al.,  J. Immunol.,  170: 1257-1266 (2003); and Flies et al.,  Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine,  84(4): 409-421 (2011)). 
     In view of the foregoing, strategies for inhibiting PD-1 activity to treat various types of cancer and for immunopotentiation (e.g., to treat infectious diseases) have been developed (see, e.g., Ascierto et al.,  Clin. Cancer. Res.,  19(5): 1009-1020 (2013)). In this respect, monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1 have been developed for the treatment of cancer (see, e.g., Weber,  Semin. Oncol.,  37(5): 430-4309 (2010); and Tang et al.,  Current Oncology Reports,  15(2): 98-104 (2013)). For example, nivolumab (also known as BMS-936558) produced complete or partial responses in non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, and renal-cell cancer in a Phase I clinical trial (see, e.g., Topalian,  New England J. Med.,  366: 2443-2454 (2012)), and is currently in Phase III clinical trials. MK-3575 is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against PD-1 that has shown evidence of antitumor activity in Phase I clinical trials (see, e.g., Patnaik et al., 2012  American Society of Clinical Oncology  ( ASCO )  Annual Meeting , Abstract #2512). In addition, recent evidence suggests that therapies which target PD-1 may enhance immune responses against pathogens, such as HIV (see, e.g., Porichis et al.,  Curr. HIV/AIDS Rep.,  9(1): 81-90 (2012)). Despite the",0.73

Some are not specific in the sites to which they will attach, which can also result in a loss of desirable activity and in a lack of reproducibility of results. In order to overcome the challenges associated with modifying proteins with poly(ethylene glycol) moieties, PEG derivatives have been developed that are more stable (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,498) or that react selectively with thiol moieties on molecules and surfaces (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,610,281). There is clearly a need in the art for PEG derivatives that are chemically inert in physiological environments until called upon to react selectively to form stable chemical bonds. 
     Recently, an entirely new technology in the protein sciences has been reported, which promises to overcome many of the limitations associated with site-specific modifications of proteins. Specifically, new components have been added to the protein biosynthetic machinery of the prokaryote  Escherichia coli  ( E. coli ) (e.g., L. Wang, et al., (2001),  Science  292:498-500) and the eukaryote  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ( S. cerevisiae ) (e.g., J. Chin et al.,  Science  301:964-7 (2003)), which has enabled the incorporation of non-genetically encoded amino acids to proteins in vivo. A number of new amino acids with novel chemical, physical or biological properties, including photoaffinity labels and photoisomerizable amino acids, keto amino acids, and glycosylated amino acids have been incorporated efficiently and with high fidelity into proteins in  E. coli  and in yeast in response to the amber codon, TAG, using this methodology.

The patent in question is titled Processes for selectively reducing the concentration of hydrogen cyanide in syngas.  The extract of text citing that article is: rations, the steel industry, non-ferrous metal industries, or captured gas from incomplete combustion processes. 
     Syngas can be a fuel but is often used as an intermediate for the production of other chemicals such as ammonia, methanol, and synthetic petroleum via the Fischer-Tropsch process. Syngas can also be bioconverted to produce alkanols, diols, carboxylic acids and esters, and alkanes such as methane. 
     Impurities in syngas generally exist due to the source of the syngas and the raw materials used to generate the syngas. Examples of impurities that can exist in syngas include, but are not limited to, acetylene, ethylene, hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, carbon disulfide, nitric oxide, and hydrogen cyanide. Some of these impurities can be deleterious to the intended application of the syngas and accordingly must be removed. In bioprocesses, certain impurities can be inhibitors to one or more metabolic pathways or can be lethal to the microorganism. See, for instance, Xu, et al.,  The Effects of Syngas Impurities on Syngas Fermentation to Liquid Fuels , Biomass and Bioenergy, 35 (2011), 2690-2696; United States Published Patent Application No. 20110097701; Abubackar, et al.,  Biological Conversion of Carbon Monoxide: Rich Syngas or Waste Gases to Bioethanol , Biofuels, Bioproducts &amp; Biorefining, 5, (2011), 93-114; and Munasinghe, et al.,  Biomass - derived Syngas Fermentation into Biofuels: Opportunities and Challenges , Bioresource Technology, 101, (2011), 5013-5022.

The patent in question is titled Azo mediators and methods of use thereof.  The extract of text citing that article is: d optionally a mediator, where the coenzyme is physicochemically changed (e.g., oxidized or reduced) and subsequently detected by suitable methods. 
     When a mediator is used, it transfers redox equivalents released during enzymatic conversion of the analyte from the physicochemically changed coenzyme to an optical indicator or conductive components of an electrode for photometric or electrochemical detection, respectively. A calibration of a measured value then yields a direct relationship with the analyte concentration to be determined. 
     Mediators are known for use in test elements to determine analyte concentration and include, for example, potassium hexacyanoferrate, ferrocene derivatives, quinones, oxazines, phenazines and thiazines. A review of mediators that directly transfer redox equivalents to a suitable detection system and that can be used for electrochemically determining blood glucose may be found in, for example, Takaminami (2008)  Mater.

When compared to the mediators described above that enable a direct transfer of redox equivalents, nitrosoanilines are characterized in that firstly a precursor compound of the actual mediator is prepared, which then is reduced to the effective mediator that has an advantage of avoiding blank reactions. 
     A problem, however, when using nitrosoanilines is that they tend to form azoxy dimers and to have a high reactivity towards substances containing amino groups and mercapto groups. See, e.g., Hinson (1986)  Adv. Exp. Med. Biol.  197:691-696). Use of nitrosoanilines thus can lead to undesired side reactions and adversely affect the specificity and sensitivity of the analyte concentration determination. 
     For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for mediators that lack the disadvantages noted above.

The patent in question is titled Unnatural reactive amino acid genetic code additions.  The extract of text citing that article is: his RNA molecule is structurally related to an alanyl tRNA and is aminoacylated by the alanyl synthetase. The difference between tmRNA and tRNA is that the anticodon loop is replaced with a special large sequence. This sequence allows the ribosome to resume translation on sequences that have stalled using an open reading frame encoded within the tmRNA as template. In the invention, an orthogonal tmRNA can be generated that is preferentially aminoacylated with an orthogonal synthetase and loaded with an unnatural amino acid. By transcribing a gene by the system, the ribosome stalls at a specific site; the unnatural amino acid is introduced at that site, and translation resumes using the sequence encoded within the orthogonal tmRNA. 
     Additional methods for producing a recombinant orthogonal tRNAs can be found, e.g., in International patent applications WO 2002/086075, entitled â€œMethods and compositions for the production of orthogonal tRNA-aminoacyltRNA synthetase pairs.â€ See also, Forster et al., (2003)  Programming peptidomimetic synthetases by translating genetic codes designed de novo PNAS  100(11):6353-6357; and, Feng et al., (2003),  Expanding tRNA recognition of a tRNA synthetase by a single amino acid change, PNAS  100(10): 5676-5681. 
     Orthogonal tRNA and Orthogonal Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase PAIRS 
     An orthogonal pair is composed of an O-tRNA, e.g., a suppressor tRNA, a frameshift tRNA, or the like, and an O-RS. The O-tRNA is not acylated by endogenous synthetases and is capable of mediating incorporation of an unnatural amino acid into a protein that is encoded by a polynucleotide that comprises a selector codon that is recognized by the O-tRNA in vivo. The O-RS recognizes the O-tRNA and preferentially aminoacylates the O-tRNA with an unnatural amino acid in a eukaryotic cell. Methods for producing orthogonal pairs along with orthogonal pairs produced by such methods and compositions of orthogonal pairs for use in eukaryotic cells are included in the invention. The development of multiple orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pairs can allow the simultaneous incorporation of multiple unnatural amino acids usin",0.96

The patent in question is titled Vertically aligned arrays of carbon nanotubes formed on multilayer substrates.  The extract of text citing that article is: , and be present at a high density on the support structure. 
     However, in spite of the tremendous potential of such materials, it has proven difficult to form dense and well aligned CNT arrays on metal surfaces, and to achieve good adhesion between the metal and CNTs. Typically, arrays of aligned carbon nanotubes are grown from surfaces containing a thin film (&lt;1 nm thick) of catalyst, such as iron, supported on a metal oxide film, such as alumina, with a thickness of between 10 and 200 nm. Under growth conditions, the catalyst forms small (&lt;10 nm) islands or particles on the surface of the oxide film from which the nanotubes grow. The catalyst particles pack on the surface, constraining the nanotube growth to a direction perpendicular to the surface. 
     Unfortunately, CNT arrays grown from these surfaces display limited density and yield. This is the result of migration of the catalyst particles into the oxide film during the course of nanotube growth. See, for example, Amama, P. B. et al. ACS Nano, 4:895-904 (2010) and Kim, S. M. et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 1:918-922 (2010). In addition, CNT arrays formed in this fashion are generally poorly adhered to underlying metal surfaces, because the oxide layer, incorporated to promote dense and aligned CNT growth, does not adhere well to the underlying metal surface. 
     In order to provide improved CNT arrays for use as thermal interface materials (TIMs), CNT arrays with higher nanotube density and improved nanotube adhesion are required. 
     Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide surfaces for the growth of high density arrays of carbon nanotubes, and methods of use thereof. 
     It is a further object of the invention to provide arrays of vertically aligned CNTs which are well adhered to a surface, such as a metallic surface. 
     It is also an object of the invention to provide arrays of vertically aligned arrays of CNTs for use as thermal interface materials (TIMs).

The patent in question is titled Multiple virus resistance in plants.  The extract of text citing that article is: ros et al. (2003). Plant miRNAs have been defined by a set of characteristics including a paired stem-loop precursor that is processed by DCL1 to a single specific Ëœ21-nucleotide miRNA, expression of a single pair of miRNA and miRNA* species from the double-stranded RNA precursor with two-nucleotide 3â€² overhangs, and silencing of specific targets in trans (see Bartel (2004); Kim (2005); Jones-Rhoades et al.

In the trans-acting siRNA (â€œta-siRNAâ€) pathway, miRNAs serve to guide in-phase processing of siRNA primary transcripts in a process that requires an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for production of a double-stranded RNA precursor; trans-acting siRNAs are defined by lack of secondary structure, a miRNA target site that initiates production of double-stranded RNA, requirements of DCL4 and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR6), and production of multiple perfectly phased Ëœ21-nt small RNAs with perfectly matched duplexes with 2-nucleotide 3â€² overhangs (see Allen et al., 2005).

The extract of text citing that article is: each sequence present in the sample, e.g., each HLA allele sequence at the same locus present in the sample. The numbers of reads corresponding to donor and recipient allele sequences are then counted to determine the presence and amount of donor allele in the sample thereby detecting graft rejection or injury. 
     The computational step is typically performed by a computer capable of executing the functions of a software program. The present invention may be practiced with any suitable software that is available or will become available for analysis of individual nucleic acid sequence reads generated by clonal sequencing. The software may have specific features uniquely suitable for the analysis of HLA sequences and assignment of HLA genotypes. For example, software may compare the sequence reads obtained from a sample to a database of known HLA alleles. An example of such database is the IMGT/HLA sequence database maintained at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), see Robinson et al. (2003)  IMGT/HLA and IMGT/MHC: sequence databases for the study of the major histocompatibility complex , Nucleic Acids Research, 31:311.

In a typical human sample, no more than four groups of sequence reads are present for each HLA sequence tested: the forward and the reverse reads for each of the two HLA alleles at the same locus. (Only two sequences will be present if the sample is derived from a homozygous individual).

See, Herman et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA  93:9821-9826, (1996); U.S. Pat. No. 5,786,146. 
     Additional methylation detection methods include, but are not limited to, methylated CpG island amplification (see, Toyota et al., Cancer Res. 59:2307-12 (1999)) and those described in, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication 2005/0069879; Rein, et al.  Nucleic Acids Res.  26 (10): 2255-64 (1998); Olek, et al.  Nat Genet.  17(3): 275-6 (1997); and PCT Publication No. WO 00/70090. 
     In some embodiments, the methods include: obtaining a biological sample from a plant; determining the methylation status of at least one cytosine (e.g., cytosine in a CHG motif) within a differential methylation region (DMR) in the sample from the plant, wherein the DMR is within a sequence of DNA at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 99% identical, or identical, to SEQ ID NO:1; and correlating the methylation status of the at least one cytosine to the presence or absence of a somaclonal abnormality in the plant, wherein the correlation comprises predicting the presence or absence of somaclonal abnormality in the plant. 
     A biological sample can be obtained by any method known in the art. In general, the biological sample is obtained in a manner that preserves the nucleic acid of the sample. In some cases, the biological sample is obtained and treated to preserve the methylation status of genomic",0.52

The extract of text citing that article is: pid monosialoganglioside composed of a ceramide lipid component, which anchors the molecule in the cell membrane, and a carbohydrate component that is exposed at the cell surface. Carbohydrate antigens are the most abundantly expressed antigens on the cell surface of cancers (Feizi T. (1985)  Nature  314:53-7). In some tumor types, such as small cell lung cancer (SCLC), initial responses to chemotherapy are impressive, but chemo-refractory relapses rapidly follow. Intervention with novel immunotherapeutics may succeed in overcoming drug resistant relapse (Johnson D H. (1995)  Lung Cancer  12 Suppl 3:S71-5). Several carbohydrate antigens, such as gangliosides GD3 and GD2, have been shown to function as effective targets for passive immunotherapy with MAbs (Irie R F and Morton D L. (1986)  PNAS  83:8694-8698; Houghton A N et al. (1985)  PNAS  82:1242-1246). Ganglioside antigens have also been demonstrated to be effective targets for active immunotherapy with vaccines in clinical trials (Krug L M et al. (2004)  Clinical Cancer Research  10:6094-6100; Dickler M N et al. (1999)  Clinical Cancer Research  5:2773-2779; Livingston P O et al. (1994)  J Clin Oncol.  12:1036-44). Indeed, serum derived from SCLC patients who developed antibody titers to Fucosyl-GM1 following vaccination with KLH conjugated antigen demonstrated specific binding to tumor cells and tumor specific complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Anti-Fucosyl-GM1 titer associated toxicities were mild and transient, and three patients with limited-stage SCLC were relapse-free at 18, 24, and 30 months (Krug et al., supra; Dickler et al., supra). 
     Fucosyl-GM1 expression has been shown in a high percentage of SCLC cases and unlike other ganglioside antigens, Fucosyl-GM1 has little or no expression in normal tissues (Nilsson et al.

The pathological hallmarks of AD include neuronal dysfunction/death, accumulation of senile plaques extracellularly and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) intraneuronally. Several hypotheses have been put forth to explain the pathophysiology of this disease, including aberrant Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) metabolism, hyperphosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins, genetic predisposition such as mutations in genes coding for presenilin-1 and -2 (PS-1 and PS-2) and amyloid precursor protein (APP), apolipoprotein E genotype, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, inflammation and abnormal cell cycle re-entry. However to date, none of these hypotheses is sufficient to explain the diversity of biochemical and pathological abnormalities in AD. 
     Two pathological hallmarks of AD are generally recognized: senile plaques composed of Î²-amyloid peptide 1-42 (AÎ² 1-42 ) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by abnormal polymerization of microtubule-associated protein tau (Walsh, D. M.; Selkoe, D. J. Deciphering the molecular basis of memory failure in Alzheimer&#39;s disease.  Neuron  2004, 44(1), 181-193.). While the precise cause underlying AD-related memory loss and cognitive changes remains to be fully elucidated, there is evidence indicating that pathological assemblies of AÎ² 1-42  cause diverse forms of AD and that tau plays a role including in mechanisms leading to AÎ² 1-42 -induced neurodegeneration. More recent evidence from studies using transgenic animals suggests that tau pathology exacerbates neurodegenerative and cognitive processes in the presence of AÎ² 1-42  (Oddo, S.; Caccamo, A.; et al. Temporal Profile of Amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) Oligomerization in an in Vivo Model of Alzheimer Disease: a link between AÎ² and tau pathology.  J. Biol. Chem.  2006, 281(3), 1599-1604.). In addition to AÎ² and tau, dysregulation of calcium homeostasis also plays an integral role in the pathophysiology of AD (Green, K. N.; LaFerla, F. M.

The patent in question is titled Thiazole orexin receptor antagonists.  The extract of text citing that article is: CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS 
     This application is a U.S. National Phase application under 35 U.S.C. Â§371 of PCT Application No. PCT/US2014/049541, filed Aug. 4, 2014, which claims priority from PCT/CN2013/081078, filed Aug. 8, 2013. 
     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     The orexins (hypocretins) comprise two neuropeptides produced in the hypothalamus: orexin A (OX-A) (a 33 amino acid peptide) and orexin B (OX-B) (a 28 amino acid peptide) (Sakurai T. et al.,  Cell,  1998, 92:573-585). Orexins are found to stimulate food consumption in rats suggesting a physiological role for these peptides as mediators in the central feedback mechanism that regulates feeding behavior (Sakurai T. et al., 1998, supra). Orexins regulate states of sleep and wakefulness opening potentially novel therapeutic approaches for narcoleptic or insomniac patients (Chemelli R. M. et al.,  Cell,  1999, 98:437-451). Orexins have also been indicated as playing a role in arousal, reward, learning and memory (Harris, et al.,  Trends Neurosci.,  2006, 29:571-577). Two orexin receptors have been cloned and characterized in mammals. They belong to the super family of G-protein coupled receptors (Sakurai T. et al.,  Cell,  1998, supra): the orexin-1 receptor (OX1 or OX1R) is selective for OX-A, and the orexin-2 receptor (OX2 or OX2R) is capable of binding OX-A as well as OX-B. The physiological actions in which orexins are presumed to participate are thought to be expressed via one or both of the OX1 receptor and the OX2 receptor as the two subtypes of orexin receptors. 
     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
     The present invention is directed to thiazole compounds that are antagonists of orexin receptors. The pres",0.0

Post-transcriptional gene silencing occurs when the guide strand binds specifically to a complementary mRNA molecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute, the catalytic component of the RISC complex. This process is known to spread systemically throughout some eukaryotic organisms despite initially limited concentrations of siRNA and/or miRNA, such as plants, nematodes, and some insects. 
     Only transcripts complementary to the siRNA and/or miRNA are cleaved and degraded, and thus the knock-down of mRNA expression is sequence-specific. In plants, several functional groups of DICER genes exist. The gene silencing effect of RNAi persists for days and, under experimental conditions, can lead to a decline in abundance of the targeted transcript of 90% or more, with consequent reduction in levels of the corresponding protein. In insects, there are at least two DICER genes, where DICER1 facilitates miRNA-directed degradation by Argonaute1. Lee et al. (2004) Cell 117(1):69-81. DICER2 facilitates siRNA-directed degradation by Argonaute2.

The extract of text citing that article is:  inhibitor in the tumor microenvironment and it&#39;s utility in tumors will clearly be dependent on the presence and activities of different Notch ligands. 
     Therapeutic Potential of Notch1 Decoys 
     Differential effects of Notch1 decoys in blocking tumor angiogenesis will be influenced by their bioavailability. Notch1 1-13  and Notch1 1-24  decoys were expressed and secreted at higher levels than Notch1 1-36  decoy, and thus may be easier to produce and potentially more effective. Analysis of tumor sections demonstrated that Notch1 1-36  decoy was restricted to the tumor vasculature as opposed to the smaller Notch1 decoy variants that were detected around the tumor vessels and diffused over the tumor cells ( FIG. 39 ). Being more diffusible, Notch1 1-13  and Notch1 10-21  decoys have the potential to affect tumor angiogenesis, tumor cells, cancer stem cells, and other cells in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor cells over-expressing JAGGED-1 promote tumor angiogenesis in mice (Zeng et al., 2005; Funahashi et al., 2008), suggesting tumor-derived JAGGED-1 could serve as an alternative angiogenic pathway in cases of VEGF blockade. Selective inhibition of JAGGED-1-mediated Notch signaling thus is important for targeting pro-tumor activities of JAGGED-1 derived from many cell types. 
     The potential advantage of the vascular localization of Notch1 1-36  decoy could be to minimize off-target side effects. A major adverse affect of Notch blockade using gamma-secretase inhibitors (van Es et al., 2005) or combined Notch1/Notch2 blocking antibodies (Wu et al., 2010) is compromised gastrointestinal function. We found Notch1 1-3 , Notch1 1-24 , Notch1 1-24  decoys induced only minimal goblet cell metaplasia relative to GSI treatment, and were tolerated by mice expressing the Notch1 decoys for up to eight weeks (data not shown). 
     Despite differences in activities and targets, Notch1 1-13 , Notch1 10-24 , Notch1 1-24  decoys were all effective at limiting tumor growth in four diff",0.5

     Assays for measuring the impact of a candidate inhibitor on the activity of a protein kinase are known in the art, and include direct phosphorylation assays, typically interpreted via radio-labeled phosphate, phosphorylation-specific antibodies to a substrate, and cell-based assays that measure the downstream consequence of kinase activity, e.g., activation of a reporter gene. Both of these major strategies, in addition to alternative assays based on fluorescence polarization, may be used in small-scale or high-throughput format to identify, validate, or characterize an inhibitor (see, for example, Favata et al.,  J.

     In Vitro Characterization of PEGylated Compound 2 in Human Embryonic Kidney Cells Stably Expressing Beta-Klotho 
     FGF21 utilizes Î²-klotho as a co-receptor along with FGF receptors for its tissue-specific signaling activity (see, e.g., Kurosu et al., 2007, J. Biol.

FGF21 first binds to Î²-klotho and the complex can then activate FGF receptors to initiate an intracellular signaling cascade that rapidly activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) over the course of minutes. Over longer times, activated, phosphorylated ERK (pERK) can translocate to the cell nucleus and phosphorylate and activate a number of transcriptional regulators including a ternary complex factor referred to as E Twenty-Six (ETS) like protein 1 (Elk1). Activated Elk1 forms a complex with serum response factor that binds to certain DNA sequences to regulate expression of certain genes.

In Equation 3 of Scheme I the boronate compound of Formula (IIâ€³) is reacted with an appropriately substituted compound A 2â€² -Lg in which Lg represents an appropriate leaving group such as triflate, chloro, bromo or iodo. It is to be appreciated that these reactions can be carried out where the A 1  and A 2  moieties in the compounds of formulae (IIâ€²) and (IIâ€³) may contain a protected carboxylic acid group which can subsequently be deprotected to provide an acid group in the compound of formula (I).

The patent in question is titled Therapeutic tetrahydronaphthalene compounds.  The extract of text citing that article is: s GPCR shares a transmembrane domain (TMD) sequence identity of about 80% with the 5HT 2A  receptor and about 70% with the 5HT 2B  receptor (Julius et al., 1988; 1990). The highly conserved TMDs and similar second messenger coupling has made development of agonist ligands selective for the 5HT 2C  receptor especially difficult. Nevertheless, there is compelling evidence that activation of 5HT 2C  receptors reduces food intake and leads to anti-obesity effects. For example, 5-HT 2C  knockout mice demonstrate increased feeding and obesity, and, they are resistant to the anorectic effects of d-fenfluramine (Tecott et al., 1995; Vickers et al., 1999; 2001; Heisler et al., 2002). Fenfluramine now is banned, because, although people using the drug showed weight loss due to activation of brain 5HT 2C  receptors, fenfluramine also activates 5HT 2A  receptors that may lead to adverse psychiatric (hallucinogenic) effects (Nichols, 2004) and 5HT 2B  receptors which causes valvular heart disease (Connolly et al., 1997; Fitzgerald et al., 2000; Rothman et al., 2000; Roth, 2007) and pulmonary hypertension (Pouwels et al., 1990; Launay et al., 2002)â€”fatalities have resulted from the 5HT 2B -mediated effects. 
     Although an agonist ligand truly selective for 5HT 2C  vs. 5HT 2A  and/or 5HT 2B  receptors has not been reported until this paper, it has been possible to partially elucidate the role of brain 5HT 2C  receptors to attenuate cocaine use and dependence using very selective (i.e., at least 100-fold) 5HT 2A  and 5HT 2C  antagonists in rat cocaine self-administration paradigms. For example, the selective 5HT 2A  antagonist M100907 (Kehne et al., 1996) does not alter responding rate for cocaine self-administration but the selective 5HT 2C  antagonist SB242084 (Bromidge et al., 1997) increases the rate of cocaine self-administration dose-dependently (Fletcher et al., 2002). The tremendous potential of 5HT 2C  agonist pharmacotherapy for psychostimulant addiction now is widely recognized (Bubar and",0.38

The patent in question is titled Inhibitors of histone deacetylase.  The extract of text citing that article is: o the molecular pathogenesis of certain neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington&#39;s disease, spinal muscular atrophy, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, and ischemia. (Langley, B. et al., Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Disord., 4, 41-50, (2005)). A recent review has summarized the evidence that aberrant histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylases (HDAC) activity may represent a common underlying mechanism contributing to neurodegeneration. HDAC activity has also been reported to contribute to long-term memory formation (Alarcon, Neuron, 42, 947-959, 2004). Moreover, using a mouse model of depression, Nestler has recently highlighted the therapeutic potential of histone deacetylation inhibitors (HDAC5) in depression (Tsankova, N. M. et al., Nat. Neurosci., 9, 519-525, (2006)). HDAC inhibition has been reported as having an effect in a variety of metabolic disorders (Pipalia, et al., PNAS, early release, approved Feb. 24, 2011; Li, et al., Diabetes, 61, 797-806 (2012); Lu, et al., PNAS, 108, 21200-21205 (2011)). The inhibition of HDAC3 has been shown to protect beta cells from cytokine-induced apoptosis (Chou, D H, et al. Chemistry &amp; biology 19, 669-673 (2012)). Histone deacetylases 1 and 3 but not 2 have been shown to mediate cytokine-induced beta cell apoptosis in INS-1 cells and dispersed primary islets from rats and are differentially regulated in the islets of type 1 diabetic children (Lundh, M, et al., Diabetologia 55, 2421-2431 (2012)). The inhibition of HDAC3 has also been reported as having a role in activating latent HIV-1 (Huber, et al., J. Bio. Chem. 286, 25, 22211-22218 (2011)). 
     There are 18 known human histone deacetylases, grouped into four classes based on the structure of their accessory domains. Class I includes HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8 and has homology to yeast RPD3. HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9 belong to class IIa and have homology to yeast HDA1.

The patent in question is titled Substituted bridged urea analogs as sirtuin modulators.  The extract of text citing that article is: after) (Jin, L. et al. (2009) J Biol Chem 284, 24394 and Frye, R. A. (2000) Biochem Biophys Res Commun 273, 793), the N-terminal region of 190-230 immediately preceding the catalytic core and a remote region in the C-terminus following the catalytic core around 640-670. 
     To probe the STAC binding site on hSIRT1, HDX-MS was performed in the absence or presence of STAC 1. Addition of 1 reduces the H-D exchange rate around residues 190-230 in the N-terminal domain of hSIRT1, suggesting that this region is involved in STACbinding. Additionally, the  1 H,  15 N HSQC spectrum of the  15 N-labeled hSIRT1(180-230) is well dispersed suggesting that it forms an autonomously folded domain. Addition of 1 to  15 N-labeled hSIRT1(180-230) results in significant chemical shift perturbations and further supports direct interaction of 1 with this region, hereafter referred to as the STAC-binding domain (SBD). Addition of 1 to hSIRT1 in the presence of a p53-derived peptide substrate (Ac-p53(W5)) (Dai, H. et al. (2010) J Biol Chem 285, 32695) results in perturbation of the H-D exchange rates both around the SBD and at the presumed substrate binding site (residues 417-424) in the catalytic core, indicating that STAC binding in the N-terminal domain and substrate binding within the catalytic core of hSIRT1 are coupled. This is consistent with a previous observation that STACs enhance substrate binding to hSIRT1, thereby increasing hSIRT1 catalytic efficiency (Milne, J. C. et al. (2007) Nature 450, 712). 
     In contrast to the SBD, the C-terminal structural element (641-665) identified by HDX-MS is separated from the catalytic core by about 150 residues and is predicted to contain several Î²-strands, referred to here as C-terminal Î²-strands/sheet (CBS), similar to the previously reported murine Essential for SIRT1 Activity (ESA) peptide (19). hSIRT1cc only shows about one eighth of the activity of the full-length enzyme using deacetylation assay conditions previously reported (Dai, H. et al.

The patent in question is titled Modulation of huntingtin expression.  The extract of text citing that article is: ngton&#39;s disease (HD) is a devastating autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion encoding an abnormally long polyglutamine (PolyQ) tract in the huntingtin protein. The Huntington disease gene was first mapped in 1993 (The Huntington&#39;s Disease Collaborative Research Group. Cell. 1993, 72:971-83), consisting of a gene, IT15, which contained a polymorphic trinucleotide repeat that is expanded and unstable on HD chromosomes. Although CAG repeats in the normal size range are usually inherited as Mendelian alleles, expanded HD repeats are unstable through meiotic transmission and are found to be expanded beyond the normal size range (6-34 repeat units) in HD patients. 
     Both normal and variant huntingtin protein are localized chiefly in the cytoplasm of neurons (DiFiglia et al., Neuron 1995, 14:1075-81). As a result of excessive polyglutamine length, huntingtin protein forms aggregates in the cytoplasm and nucleus of CNS neurons (Davies et al., Cell 1997, 90:537-548). Both transgenic animals and genetically modified cell lines have been used to investigate the effects of expanded polyQ repeats on the localization and processing of huntingtin. However, it is still unclear whether the formation of aggregates per se is the essential cytotoxic step or a consequence of cellular dysfunction. 
     HD is characterized by progressive chorea, psychiatric changes and intellectual decline. This dominant disorder affects males and females equally, and occurs in all races (Gusella and MacDonald, Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995 5:656-62). Symptoms of HD are due to the death of neurons in many brain regions, but is most apparent in the striatum, particularly in the caudate nucleus, which suffers a progressive gradient of cell loss that ultimately decimates the entire structure. Although the gene encoding huntingtin is expressed ubiquitously (Strong, T. V. et al., Nat. Genet. 1995, 5:259-263), selective cell loss and fibrillary astrocytosis is observed i",0.8

The patent in question is titled Conserved HBV and HCV sequences useful for gene silencing.  The extract of text citing that article is: nables systemic administration. In addition, targeting ligands to cell surface receptors may be attached to the modifier providing for targeted delivery of DNA directly to target cells of interest. Since hepatocytes are susceptible to HBV and HCV infection, utilizing this method to target delivery of the dsRNA expression constructs of the invention to liver cells is considered especially advantageous. E.g., the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) on mammalian hepatocytes may be targeted by use of synthetic ligands with galactosylated or lactosylated residues, such as galactosylated polymers. 
     In general, targeting for selective delivery of the dsRNA constructs of the invention to hepatocytes is preferred. Targeting to hepatocytes may be achieved by coupling to ligands for hepatocyte-specific receptors. For example, asialo-orosomucoid, (poly)L-lysine-asialo-orosomucoid, or any other ligands of the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (Spiess, Biochemistry 29(43):10009-10018, 1990; Wu et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267(18):12436-12439, 1992; Wu et al., Biotherapy 3:87-95, 1991). Similarly, the oligonucleotides may be targeted to hepatocytes by being conjugated to monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to hepatocyte-specific receptors. Oligonucleotides may also be targeted to hepatocytes using specific vectors, as described below. 
     Particularly preferred compositions for delivery of dsRNAs or dsRNA expression constructs of the invention are the multifunctional compositions as described in PCT/US03/14288, filed May 6, 2003, which may include trilactosyl spermine as a ligand for targeting to the ASG Receptor of hepatocytes. Trilactosyl cholesteryl spermine co-complexes with the oligonucleotides of the invention may be prepared and used as described to transfect hepatocytes in vivo.

The patent in question is titled Topical compositions comprising fipronil and permethrin and methods of use.  The extract of text citing that article is:  fipronil sulfone at the time of formulation with NMP. Some grades of fipronil may have lower levels of fipronil sulfone, even 0%. However, once fipronil is contacted with NMP, it is believed that fipronil sulfone may continue to form in solution. Further, it is significantly more costly to use fipronil that is completely free of fipronil sulfone. However, the formulation described herein advantageously minimize or substantially slow further fipronil sulfone formation compared to formulations with other common solvents used in topical compositions no matter how much is present at the time of formulation.
 
     The solvent system described herein was designed after the finding that fipronil is susceptible to fipronil sulfone formation in the presence of NMP. While not being bound to any particular theory, it is believed that peroxides present in NMP can facilitate the formation of fipronil sulfone. Furthermore, it is known that NMP can generate peroxides in the presence of oxygen (see Drago and Riley,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.  1990, 112, 215-218; Reynolds et al.,  Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences,  2012, 101(2), pp. 761-776). Thus, it has been found that NMP, while a useful solvent, poses technical hurdles when used as a solvent for fipronil in a concentrated topical formulation, such as a spot-on formulation. The oxidation of fipronil in NMP must be addressed since NMP is an effective solvent for permethrin at the concentration levels present in the formulations disclosed herein. However, the required amount of NMP in the formulations of the invention was unexpectedly observed to result in the oxidation of fipronil to fipronil sulfone at levels that were higher than desired. 
     N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) is a chemical compound with a 5-membered lactam structure. It is a clear to slightly yellow liquid soluble in water and conventional organic solvents. It is a polar aprotic solvent and a very weak base. Other names for this compound are: 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, and m-pyrrole, and P",0.71

The patent in question is titled Nanocrystals compositions and methods that aid particle transport in mucus.  The extract of text citing that article is: iling to contact cells in the rugae. Conversely, hydrophilic molecules can diffuse rapidly through the vaginal epithelium and be carried away by blood and lymph circulation leading to brief periods of coverage. BD-MPP was loaded with a fluorescent, water-soluble small molecule, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), as a model drug (FITC/MPP). To mimic conventional vaginal delivery, soluble FITC (FITC/gel) was administered in the universal vaginal placebo gel hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC). Twenty-four hours after administration to estrus phase mice, the vaginal tissues were excised and flattened to expose the vaginal folds. Patches of FITC coated 42% of the vaginal surface when administered as FITC/gel, whereas FITC/MPP provided a well-retained FITC coating of 87% of the vaginal surface ( FIG. 22 ), even 24 h after particle administration. 
     To further characterize the effects of the mucus barrier, we found that removing vaginal mucus by lavage (Cu Y et al., J Cont Rel 156:258-64, 2011; Woodrow K A et al. Nat Mater 8:526-33, 2009) prior to particle administration markedly improved CP distribution, indicating that their mucoadhesive character prevents uniform distribution in the vagina ( FIG. 19 ). 
     It was next sought to determine vaginal retention of MPPs compared to mucoadhesive CPs using our IE model. Fluorescent MPPs and CPs were administered intravaginally to IE mice. At specified time points, the entire reproductive tract (vagina and uterine horns) was excised and analyzed quantitatively with fluorescence imaging ( FIG. 21A ). After an initial decrease in particle fluorescence that was similar for MPP and CP (likely owing to initial â€œsqueeze outâ€ preceding mucus penetration), the remaining amount of MPPs stayed constant at roughly 60% ( FIG. 21B ). In contrast, the amount of CPs steadily decreased with time to 10% (6 h). Importantly, although CPs were distributed along the length of the vagina, this longitudinal coverage does not indicate that the CP penetrated mucus to reach the epithelium, nor surf",0.98

The patent in question is titled Methods for raising antibodies.  The extract of text citing that article is:  Chemical methods, buffers and combinations of detergents, such as nonionic detergent, can also be employed. Generally, lysis buffers contain alkali (such as NaOH), guanidine salts (such as guanidine thiocyanate), tris-HCl, EDTA, EGTA, SDS, deoxycholate, tritonX and/or NP-40. In some cases the buffer may also contain NaCl (150 mM). An exemplary chemical lysis buffer is (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% (w/v) 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), 65 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor at âˆ’80Â° C.). Other such buffers are known in the art and are commercially available. 
     In particular embodiments, the species (such as a pathogen or bacteria) is lysed using thermal methods. In thermal lysis, the species is heated to about 90Â° C., about 95Â° C., about 100Â° C., etc., causing the species (such as a pathogen or bacteria) to lyse. Thermal lysis procedures are described for example in Privorotskaya et al. (Lab Chip. 2010 May 7; 10 (9):1135-41) and Kim et al. (Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Vol. 9, 2841-2845, 2009), the content of each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Application of heat not only lyses the species, it also denatures the released double stranded nucleic acid into single stranded nucleic acid and initiates the amplification reaction. Another advantage of thermal lysis is that the heat facilitates denaturation/inactivation of nucleases that can cause degradation of nucleic acid. 
     After lysis, an amplification reaction is conducted on the nucleic acid released form the species.

     In various embodiments, the nucleic acid is amplified, for example, from the sample or after isolation from the sample. Amplification refers to production of additional copies of a nucleic acid sequence and is generally conducted using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or other technologies well-known in the art (e.g., Dieffenbach and Dveksler, PCR Primer, a Laboratory Manual, 1995, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, N.Y.).

Because of their broad protective activities, EPO and EPO mimetics are promising agents also for the treatment of diabetes mellitus (Choi et al., Curr Diabetes Rev. (2011) 7:284). 
     EPOR is abundantly expressed in the CNS, including neurons, astrocytes and choroid plexus epithelial cells (Bernaudin et al., J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. (1999) 19:643; Digicaylioglu et al., PNAS (1995) 92:3717; SirÃ©n et al., Acta Neuropathol. (2001) 101:271). The presence of EPOR is critical for early embryonic neural development as well as for adult neurogenesis and migration of regenerating neurons during post-stroke recovery (Tsai et al., J. Neurosci. (2006) 26:1269). While the expression of EPOR decreases in normal adult neural tissues (Liu et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1997) 272:32395), the expression of both EPO and its receptor is upregulated following ischemia, supporting a critical role for the EPO/EPOR system in protection against ischemic brain injury (Bernaudin et al., J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. (1999) 19:643). EPO and EPO mimetics are also implicated to have beneficial protective effects in glaucoma, optic nerve injury, age-related macular degeneration, chronic diabetic macular edema, retinopathy, peripheral nerve injury and in peripheral neuropathy associated with for example diabetes or chemotherapy (Bianchi, Eur J Cancer.

     IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (NADP+), cytosolic) is also known as IDH; IDP; IDCD; IDPC or PICD. The protein encoded by this gene is the NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase found in the cytoplasm and peroxisomes. It contains the PTS-1 peroxisomal targeting signal sequence. The presence of this enzyme in peroxisomes suggests roles in the regeneration of NADPH for intraperoxisomal reductions, such as the conversion of 2, 4-dienoyl-CoAs to 3-enoyl-CoAs, as well as in peroxisomal reactions that consume 2-oxoglutarate, namely the alpha-hydroxylation of phytanic acid. The cytoplasmic enzyme serves a significant role in cytoplasmic NADPH production.

     Diseases that may be treated with enhance affinity TCR therapy include cancer, infectious diseases (viral, bacterial, protozoan infections), and autoimmune diseases. TCR gene therapy is a promising treatment for various types of cancer (Morgan et al., 2006, Science 314:126-129; reviewed in Schmitt et al, 2009, Human Gene Therapy; reviewed in June, 2007, J. Clin.

The patent in question is titled Methods and compositions for inhibiting polyomavirus-associated pathology.  The extract of text citing that article is:  microcapsules, nanocapsules, nanospheres, and nanoparticles. Microcapsules contain the therapeutic protein as a central core. In microspheres, the therapeutic agent is dispersed throughout the particle. Particles, microspheres, and microcapsules smaller than about 1 Î¼m are generally referred to as nanoparticles, nanospheres, and nanocapsules, respectively. Capillaries have a diameter of approximately 5 Î¼m so that only nanoparticles are administered intravenously. Microparticles are typically around 100 Î¼m in diameter and are administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly (see Kreuter,  Colloidal Drug Delivery Systems , J. Kreuter, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., pp. 219-342, 1994; Tice &amp; Tabibi,  Treatise on Controlled Drug Delivery , A. Kydonieus, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York, N.Y., pp. 315-339, 1992). 
     Polymers can be used for controlled release. Various degradable and nondegradable polymeric matrices for use in controlled drug delivery are known in the art (Langer,  Accounts Chem. Res.  26:537, 1993). For example, the block copolymer, polaxamer 407 exists as a viscous yet mobile liquid at low temperatures but forms a semisolid gel at body temperature. It has shown to be an effective vehicle for formulation and sustained delivery of recombinant interleukin-2 and urease (Johnston et al.,  Pharm. Res.  9:425, 1992; and Pec,  J. Parent. Sci. Tech.  44(2):58, 1990). Alternatively, hydroxyapatite has been used as a microcarrier for controlled release of proteins (Ijntema et al.,  Int. J. Pharm.  112:215, 1994). In yet another aspect, liposomes are used for controlled release as well as drug targeting of the lipid-capsulated drug (Betageri et al.,  Liposome Drug Delivery Systems , Technomic Publishing Co., Inc., Lancaster, Pa., 1993).

The patent in question is titled Liquid crystal based analyte detection.  The extract of text citing that article is: e functional group. This functional group attaches the molecule to the substrate. â€œMonovalent moietiesâ€ are to be contrasted with the bifunctional â€œspacerâ€ groups described above. Such monovalent groups are used to modify the hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, binding characteristics, etc. of the substrate surface. Examples of groups useful for this purpose include long chain alcohols, amines, fatty acids, fatty acid derivatives, poly(ethyleneglycol) monomethyl ethers, etc. 
     When two or more structurally distinct moieties are used as components of the SAMs, the components can be contacted with the substrate as a mixture of SAM components or, alternatively, the components can be added individually. In those embodiments in which the SAM components are added as a mixture, the mole ratio of a mixture of the components in solution results in the same ratio in the mixed SAM. Depending on the manner in which the SAM is assembled, the two components do not phase segregate into islands (See, Bain and Whitesides,  J. Am. Chem. Soc.  111:7164 (1989)). This feature of SAMs can be used to immobilize recognition moieties or bulky modifying groups in such a manner that certain interactions, such as steric hindrance, between these molecules is minimized. 
     The individual components of the SAMs can also be bound to the substrate in a sequential manner. Thus, in one embodiment, a first SAM component is attached to the substrate&#39;s surface by â€œunderlabelingâ€ the surface functional groups with less than a stoichiometric equivalent of the first component. The first component can be a SAM component liked to a terminal reactive group or recognition group, a spacer arm or a monovalent moiety. Subsequently, the second component is contacted with the substrate. This second component can either be added in stoichiometric equivalence, stoichiometric excess or can again be used to underlabel to leave sites open for a third component.

The patent in question is titled ICOS critically regulates the expansion and function of inflammatory human Th17 cells.  The extract of text citing that article is: uced IL-4 production by TH2 cells ( FIG. 1C , ii). IL-10 and IL-22 secretion was triggered by both CD28 and ICOS costimulation in a subset-specific manner, although in most subsetsCD28 costimulation induced higher amounts of these cytokines ( FIG. 1C , iv and v). In contrast, ICOS costimulation of Th17 cells resulted in significantly higher production of IL-17A, IL-17F, CCL20, and IL-21 compared with CD28 costimulation ( FIG. 1C , vi to ix). Notably, ICOS-stimulatedTh17 cells also produced greater amounts of IFN-Î³ than CD28-stimulated TH1 cells, a subset reported to be a dominant source of IFN-Î³ secretion ( FIG. 1C , iii). Although ICOS costimulation augments Th17 cell function, it is interesting that this signal did not amplify TH1 or TH2 cell function, likely because these cells lack ICOS. 
     Example 2: ICOS Drives Human Th17 Cell Differentiation 
     Costimulatory molecules play critical roles in initiating T cell responses (Greenwald et al., 2005 Annu Rev. Immunol. 23:515-548; Smith et al., 1994 Cell 76:959-962), but their individual influence on human Th17 functionality remains unknown. To understand their respective impact onTh17 function, peripheral blood CD4+ T cells were activated with OKT3-loaded artificial APCs (aAPCs) engineered to express CD86, CD80, CD70, ICOSL, OX40L, or 4-1BBL and then cultured the cells in Th17-polarizing conditions (IL-6, IL-1b, IL-23, neutralizing IFN-Î³, and neutralizing IL-4 antibodies in serum containing endogenous sources of TGF-Î²). Only ICOS costimulation reproducibly induced IL-17F secretion ( FIG. 2A ), supporting the notion that ICOS might play a unique role in human Th17 cell development. 
     The next set of experiments was designed to assess whether ICOS engagement alone might be sufficient to induce IL-17F secretion by bulk unpolarized CD4+ T cells. It was observed that ICOS engagement was not sufficient to promote significant IL-17F production in the absence of Th17-polarizing conditions. However, in the presence of Th17-polarizing",0.75

     Example 6 
     Analysis of Sample Purity by HPLC. An Agilent 1260 infinity HPLC system was used, which consisted of a variable wavelength detector (G1314A), a thermostatted column compartment (G1316A), an autosampler (G1329B), an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD, G4261A), a quaternary pump (G1311B), and a C-18 reverse phase column (Agilent Poroshell 120, 2.7 Î¼m, 4.6 mmÃ—50 mm). The experiments were run with 5 Î¼L (0.5 mg/mL in water) injections, and sample elution was monitored by UV absorbance at 210 nm and by ELSD in a linear gradient experiment (water/acetonitrile with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, gradient system: from initial 2% acetonitrile to 100% acetonitrile in 7 min, then 100% acetonitrile for 3 min).

     Molecular modeling. All renderings were performed in PyMol. (Koo, Y. K.; Nandi, D.; Silverman, R. B.  Arch. Biochem. Biophys.  2000, 374 (2), 248 254.) Computer simulations were carried out as previously described. (Silverman, R. B.; Bichler, K. A.; Leon, A. J.  J. Am. Chem. Soc.  1996, 118 (6), 1241 1252.) In short, the ligands (as adducts with the cofactor) were prepared using the R.E.D. server and transformed into topology files using the Antechamber module of the AMBER program. (Yuan, H.; Silverman, R. B.  Bioorganic Med. Chem.  2006, 14 (5), 1331-1338.) The non-tautomerized molecules were then docked into the active site of GABA-AT (prepared from pdb entry #1OHW) using Autodock 4.2, with Lys329 as a flexible sidechain. The best docked structures were then refined by molecular mechanics, using GROMACS 4.5. The sequence involved energy minimization, molecular dynamics (4 ns), and a final energy minimization. At this stage, structures were tautomerized in place, and the molecular mechanics sequence was performed again. The final output structures were used for evaluation without further refinement.

The patent in question is titled Serine protease molecules and therapies.  The extract of text citing that article is:  in a very specific embodiment of the invention, there is provided a cell targeting construct comprising human GrB conjugated to scFvMEL. 
     In yet further specific embodiments of the invention, cell targeting constructs may be directed to breast cancer cells. For example cell targeting moieties that bind to Her-2/neu, such as anti-Her-2/neu antibodies may conjugated to GrB. One example of such a cell targeting construct is a fusion protein comprising the single chain anti-Her-2/neu antibody scFv23 and GrB. Other scFv antibodies such as scFv(FRP5) that bind to Her-2/neu may also be used in the compositions and methods of the current embodiments (von Minckwitz et al., 2005). 
     In certain additional embodiments, it is envisioned that cancer cell targeting moieties bind to multiple types of cancer cells. For example, the 8H9 monoclonal antibody and the single chain antibodies derived therefrom bind to a glycoprotein that is expressed on breast cancers, sarcomas and neuroblastomas (Onda et al., 2004). Another example are the cell targeting agents described in U.S. patent application no. 2004005647 and in Winthrop et al., 2003 that bind to MUC-1, an antigen that is expressed on a variety cancer types. Thus, it will be understood that in certain embodiments, cell targeting constructs according the embodiments may be targeted against a plurality of cancer or tumor types. 
     Additionally, certain cell surface molecules are highly expressed in tumor cells, including hormone receptors such as human chorionic gonadotropin receptor and gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor (Nechushtan et al., 1997). Therefore, the corresponding hormones may be used as the cell-specific targeting moieties in cancer therapy. 
     Since a large number of cell surface receptors have been identified in hematopoietic cells of various lineages, ligands or antibodies specific for these receptors may be used as cell-specific targeting moieties. IL2 may also be used as a cell-specific targeting moiety in a chimeric protein to target IL2R+ cells. Alternatively, other molecules such as B7-1, B7-2 and C",0.2

The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % homology=# of identical positions/total # of positionsÃ—100). The determination of percent homology between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. A preferred, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin et al.,  Proc Natl Acad Sci USA  87:2264-8 (1990), modified as in Karlin et al.,  Proc Natl Acad Sci USA  90:5873-7 (1993).

The patent in question is titled Method and nucleic acids for the analysis of colon cell proliferative disorders.  The extract of text citing that article is:  DNA to be analysed in an agarose matrix, thus preventing the diffusion and renaturation of the DNA (bisulfite only reacts with single-stranded DNA), and which replaces all precipitation and purification steps with fast dialysis (Olek A, Oswald J, Walter J. A modified and improved method for bisulphite based cytosine methylation analysis. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996 Dec. 15; 24(24):5064-6). Using this method, it is possible to analyse individual cells, which illustrates the potential of the method. However, currently only individual regions of a length of up to approximately 3000 base pairs are analysed, a global analysis of cells for thousands of possible methylation events is not possible. However, this method cannot reliably analyse very small fragments from small sample quantities either. These are lost through the matrix in spite of the diffusion protection. 
     An overview of the further known methods of detecting 5-methylcytosine may be gathered from the following review article: Rein, T., DePamphilis, M. L., Zorbas, H., Nucleic Acids Res. 1998, 26, 2255.

The patent in question is titled Soluble hybrid Fc.gamma. receptors and related methods.  The extract of text citing that article is: e plasmon resonance analyses. A monoclonal human IgG1 antibody was immobilized to the sensor surface in a single flow cell at an RU (resonance units) level of 485, a density level within optimal levels for kinetic analysis of FcÎ³RIA-CH6, presuming a binding stoichiometry of one FcÎ³RIA molecule with one IgG1 molecule (Woof and Burton,  Nature Rev. Immunol.  4:1-11, 2004). FcÎ³RIA rapidly bound to immobilized IgG1 with rates of association and dissociation of 2.8Ã—10 6  M âˆ’1 s âˆ’1  and 4.6Ã—10 âˆ’4  s âˆ’1 , respectively, values which yield a calculated equilibrium dissociation constant of 1.7Ã—10 âˆ’10  M. These data are similar to those reported previously (Paetz A et al.,  Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.  338:1811-1817, 2005) and demonstrate that FcÎ³RIA-CH6 binds with high affinity to human IgG1. 
     Mast cells are thought to mediate immune complex-mediated inflammation in a variety of immune disorders such as type II hypersensitivity reactions (Ravetch,  J. Clin.

Binding of immune complexes to mast cell FcÎ³ receptors is thought to induce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNFÎ± (Ravetch, supra; Jancar and Crespo, supra), which subsequently leads to neutrophil infiltration and tissue damage. To evaluate whether cytokine secretion from mast cells could be stimulated by immune complexes, the murine mast cell line MC/9 was incubated in the presence and absence of preformed rabbit anti-OVA/OVA immune complexes. Incubation with anti-OVA/OVA immune complexes produced a time and concentration dependent increase in the accumulation of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-13, TNFÎ±, and MCP-1 within the MC/9 cell conditioned media. Cytokine production was not altered, in contrast, when MC/9 cells were incubated with an equivalent concentration of rabbit anti-OVA IgG alone.

The pH of the diluted sample is checked to ensure that it is between 6.5 and 7.5 and tested for total phosphorus. The phosphorus concentration in the water wash should be less than 7% of what would be expected if all of the GPS used in the synthesis were present in the DI water wash solution. This same polymer is then placed in 4M NaOH solution and stirred for 24 h to remove the bound GSP. A filtered aliquot is then taken and the sample&#39;s pH adjusted to be between 6.5 and 7.5 using HCl. The polymer is placed in a fresh 4M NaOH solution and stirred for another 24 hours. This solution is then tested for total phosphorus. The total phosphorus concentration in the base wash is usually 95% of what would be expected upon full GSP-Ba template removal from the imprinted gel. 
     Glucose substrate binding capacities of poly(allylamine)-derived MIPs are determined via batch reactor studies as described in Wizeman and Kofinas, 2001, Biomaterials 22:1485-91. According to the procedure described therein, MIPs can be added to an aqueous or buffered solution of pure glucose or fructose (at about 50 mg/ml) or to a solution comprising a 1:1 mixture of the two sugars.

     But the lowering of serum triglycerides is not a stand alone effect. Treatment of db/db or ob/ob mice with synthetic FXR agonist GW4064 resulted in marked and combined reduction of serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, free fatty acids, ketone bodies such as 3-OH Butyrate. Moreover, FXR activation engages with the intracellular insulin signaling pathway in hepatocytes, resulting in reduced output of glucose from liver gluconeogenesis but concomitant increase in liver glycogen. Insulin sensitivity as well as glucose tolerance were positively impacted by FXR treatment (K. R. Stayrook et al., Endocrinology 2005, 146, 984; Y. Zhang et al., PNAS 2006, 103, 1006; B. Cariou et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2006, 281, 11039; K. Ma et al., J. Clin. Invest. 2006, 116, 1102; D. Duran-Sandoval et al., Biochimie 2005, 87, 93). An effect on reduction of body weight was also recently observed in mice overfed with a high lipid diet (C. Lihong et al., American Diabetes Association (ADA) 66 th  annual scientific sessions, June 2006, Abstract Number 856-P). This weight loss effect might results from FXR&#39;s induction of FGF-19, a fibroblast growth factor that is known to lead to weight loss and athletic phenotype (J. Holt et al., Genes Dev. 2003, 17, 1581; E. Tomlinson et al., Endocrinology 2002, 143, 1741). In recent patent applications, the effect of FXR agonist on reduction of body weight was demonstrated (WO 2004/087076; WO 2003/080803). 
     Taken together, these pharmacological effects of FXR agonists can be exploited in different therapeutic ways: FXR binding compounds are thought to be good candidates for the treatment of Type II Diabetes because of their insulin sensitization, glycogenogenic, and lipid lowering effects.

     Normally, endothelial cells (EC) migrate and proliferate to cover denuded areas until confluence is achieved. Migration, quantitatively more important than proliferation, proceeds under normal blood flow roughly at a rate of 25 Î¼m/hr or 2.5 times the diameter of an EC, which is nominally 10 Î¼m. EC migrate by a rolling motion of the cell membrane, coordinated by a complex system of intracellular filaments attached to clusters of cell membrane integrin receptors, specifically focal contact points. The integrins within the focal contact sites are expressed according to complex signaling mechanisms and eventually couple to specific amino acid sequences in substrate adhesion molecules (such as RGD, mentioned above). An EC has roughly 16-22% of its cell surface represented by integrin clusters. Davies, P. F., Robotewskyi A., Griem M. L.  Endothelial cell adhesion in real time. J. Clin. Invest.  1993; 91:2640-2652, Davies, P. F., Robotewski, A., Griem, M. L.,  Qualitative studies of endothelial cell adhesion, J. Clin. Invest.  1994; 93:2031-2038.

The focal adhesion contacts vary in size and distribution, but 80% of them measure less than 6 Î¼m2, with the majority of them being about 1 Î¼m 2 , and tend to elongate in the direction of flow and concentrate at leading edges of the cell. Although the process of recognition and signaling to determine specific attachment receptor response to attachment sites is incompletely understood, regular availability of attachment sites, more likely than not, would favorably influence attachment and migration.

     Identifying Unique Genes in the Genome of  Bifidobacterium Longum  Infantis 35624 
     Assignment of protein function to predicted coding regions of the  Bifidobacterium longum  biotype infantis strain 35624 genome was performed using internally developed software and manual inspection. Primary functional classification of the  Bifidobacterium longum  biotype infantis strain 35624 gene products was performed according to the Riley rules (Riley, 1998a; Riley, 1993). The COG assignment was performed using XUGNITOR (Tatusov,). HMMER (Eddy,) was used to assign PFAM (Bateman et al., 2002) classification to the predicted proteins. TMHMM (Krogh et al., 2001) was used to predict transmembrane sequences, and SignalP (Bendtsen et al., 2004) was used for the prediction of signal peptides. Ribosomal RNA genes were detected on the basis of BLASTN searches and annotated manually. Transfer RNA genes were identified using tRNAscan-SE (Lowe and Eddy, 1997). Miscellaneous-coding RNAs were identified using the Rfam database (Griffiths-Jones et al., 2005) utilizing the INFERNAL software package (Eddy, 2002). Insertion sequence elements were identified using Repeatfinder (Volfovsky et al., 2001), Reputer (Kurtz &amp; Schleiermcher, 1999) and BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) and annotated manually. IS families were assigned using ISFinder. Carbohydrate-active enzymes were identified based on similarity to the carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZy) database entries (Coutinho &amp; Henrissat, 1999), and COG and PFAM classes annotated with carbohydrate enzyme activity. Transporter classification was performed according to the TC-DB scheme (Busch &amp; Saier, 2002). 
     We identified a region from base numbers 44824 to 472245 (inclusive) of SEQ ID No. 1 that we designated exopolysaccharide (EPS) region 1 (SEQ ID No. 2). The EPS region 1 encodes the following genes:

     Studies on Induction of iPS Cells After Exposure to a Protein Agent and its Peptide Derivatives (Examples 1-15) 
     Introduction 
     Direct reprogramming of somatic cells provides an opportunity to generate patient- or disease-specific pluripotent stem cells. Recently, pioneering work by Yamanaka and colleagues identified key transcription factors that, when overexpressed, enable reprogramming of a somatic cells to a pluripotent state (Takahashi, K. &amp; Yamanaka, S. Cell 126, 663-676 (2006)). It is now possible to reprogram mouse and human somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by ectopic expression of the factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC or a different set of for factors (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG and LIN-28) (Okita, K., et al., Nature 448, 313-317 (2007); Takahashi, K., et al., Nat Protoc 2, 3081-3089 (2007); Maherali, N., et al. Cell Stem Cell 1, 55-70 (2007); Wernig, M., et al., Nature 448, 318-324 (2007); Yu, J., et al., Science 318, 1917-1920 (2007); Park, I. H., et al., Nature 451, 141-146 (2008); and Lowry, W. E., et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105, 2883-2888 (2008). Human iPS cell closely resemble embryonic stem (ES) cells in gene expression, pluripotency and epigenetic states, and hold great potential for regenerative medicine and in vitro disease modeling. However, the integration of vial transgenes into the somatic genome, especially oncogenes such as c-MYC and KLF, limits the utility of iPS cells. Indeed, reactivation of the c-Myc retrovirus contri",0.91

The patent in question is titled Protein kinase C inhibitors and uses thereof.  The extract of text citing that article is: for immunosuppression in transplantation and autoimmune diseases (Isakov et al. (2002) Annual Review of Immunology, 20, 761-794). PCT Publication WO2004/043386 identifies PKC Î¸ as a target for treatment of transplant rejection and multiple sclerosis. PKC Î¸ also plays a role in inflammatory bowel disease (The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (2005), 313 (3), 962-982), asthma (WO 2005062918), and lupus (Current Drug Targets: Inflammation &amp; Allergy (2005), 4 (3), 295-298). 
     In addition, PKC Î¸ is highly expressed in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Blay, P. et al. (2004) Clinical Cancer Research, 10, 12, Pt. 1), it has been suggested that PKC Î¸ is a molecular target for treatment of gastrointestinal cancer (Wiedmann, M. et al. (2005) Current Cancer Drug Targets 5(3), 171). 
     Experiments induced in PKC Î¸ knock-out mice led to the conclusion that PKC Î¸ inactivation prevented fat-induced defects in insulin signalling and glucose transport in skeletal muscle (Kim J. et al, 2004, The J. of Clinical Investigation 114 (6), 823). This data indicates PKC Î¸ is a therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and hence PKC Î¸ inhibitors can be useful for treating such disease.

The patent in question is titled 3-hydroxypropionic acid production by recombinant yeasts expressing an insect aspartate 1-decarboxylase.  The extract of text citing that article is:  has at least 20%, e.g., at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100% of the ADC activity of any polypeptide described herein (e.g., any of SEQ ID NOs: 162-195) under the same conditions. 
     The ADC may be a fused polypeptide or cleavable fusion polypeptide in which another polypeptide is fused at the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the ADC. A fused polypeptide may be produced by fusing a polynucleotide encoding another polypeptide to a polynucleotide encoding the ADC. Techniques for producing fusion polypeptides are known in the art, and include ligating the coding sequences encoding the polypeptides so that they are in frame and that expression of the fused polypeptide is under control of the same promoter(s) and terminator. Fusion proteins may also be constructed using intein technology in which fusions are created post-translationally (Cooper et al., 1993 , EMBO J.  12: 2575-2583; Dawson et al., 1994 , Science  266: 776-779).

The extract of text citing that article is: stic properties, we then characterized the effects of 2C10 in vivo. Recombinant mouse-rhesus chimeric forms of 2C10 were generated using either rhesus IgG 1 (2C10R1) or IgG4 (2C10R4) heavy chain and rhesus kappa light chain constant region sequences. A chimeric rhesus IgG1 form of 3A8 (3A8R1) was also generated for use as a control. 
     Rhesus macaques were immunized once on day zero with 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl-conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH, 10 mg IM) antigen (Biosearch Technologies, Novato, Calif.). Prior to immunization and at one week, cohorts of three animals received an intravenous dose (50 mg/kg) of 2C10R1, 2C10R4, 3A8R1, or saline. All animals were observed for 70 days, and flow cytometry was performed weekly. Treatment with either recombinant 2C10 isotypes resulted in modest change in peripheral B cell counts ( FIG. 8 ) compared to the previously reported significant and prolonged depletion of peripheral B cells occurring in animals receiving either 3A8R1 (Badell et al.,  Am. J. Transplant.  10:214, 2010) or Chi220 (Adams et al.,  J. Immunol.  174:542-50, 2005). 
     T cell-dependent antibody responses to KLH-NP were tested by ELISA. Plates were coated with KLH (0.01 mg/ml, Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and blocked with Super Block (Thermo Scientific, Woodstock, Ga.). Pre- and post-treatment plasma samples were serially diluted, plated for 1 hr, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline/0.05% Tween. Anti-KLH antibodies were detected by incubating for 1 hr with monoclonal anti-rhesus IgG-horseradish peroxidase (clone 1B3, NHP Reagent Resource, Boston, Mass.). Plates were then incubated with Peroxidase Substrate Solution (KPL). Stop solution (KPL) was then added, and optical density was read on an ELISA plate reader at 450 nm. A sample was considered positive at a given dilution if the optical density reading of the post-treatment plasma exceeded the optical density of the pre-treatment plasma at the same dilution by 2-fold.

(See L. Dang et al., Trends Mol. Med., 2010, 16, 387; T. Shibata et al., Am. J. Pathol., 2011, 178(3), 1395; Gaal et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2010; Hayden et al., Cell Cycle, 2009; Balss et al., Acta Neuropathol., 2008). The mutations have been found at or near key residues in the active site: G97D, R100, R132, H133Q, and A134D for IDH1, and R140 and R172 for IDH2. (See L. Dang et al., Nature, 2009, 462, 739; L. Sellner et al., Eur. J. Haematol., 2011, 85, 457). 
     These mutant forms of IDH are shown to have a neomorphic activity (also known as a gain of function activity), reducing alpha-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). (See P. S. Ward et al., Cancer Cell, 2010, 17, 225) In general, production of 2-HG is enantiospecific, resulting in generation of the D-enantiomer (also known as R enantiomer or R-2-HG). Normal cells have low native levels of 2-HG, whereas cells harboring these mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 show significantly elevated levels of 2-HG. High levels of 2-HG have been detected in tumors harboring the mutations. For example, high levels of 2-HG have been detected in the plasma of patients with mutant IDH containing AML. (See S. Gross et al., J. Exp. Med., 2010, 207(2), 339). High levels of 2-HG are highly associated with tumorigenesis. 
     Mutant IDH2 is also associated with the rare neurometabolic disorder D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria type II (D-2-HGA type II). Germline mutations were found at R140 in IDH2 in 15 pateints having D-2-HGA type II. Patients having this disorder also have consistently increased levels of D-2-HG in their urine, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. (See Kranendijk, M. et al., Science, 2010, 330, 336). Finally, ",0.56

The patent in question is titled ROR modulators and their uses.  The extract of text citing that article is: ssor proteins and upon ROR DBD binding to the ROR responsive element of the target genes lead to the induction or inhibition of ROR-regulated gene transcriptional activity. Therefore, small molecule drugs that bind to the nuclear receptor LBDs such as ROR could elicit a variety of pharmacological responses, including activation (agonists), inactivation (antagonists or non-agonists), and for receptors that are constitutively active, ligands can downregulate the constitutive response (inverse agonists). 
     RORÎ³t is the master regulator of human T Helper 17 (T H 17) cell differentiation, function and cytokine production (Ivanov et al. (2006)  Cell,  126:1121-1133). The critical role of T H 17 cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases has been established and is conferred by the production of its signature proinflammatory cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17AF, IL-21, IL-22 (Ghoreschi et al. (2010)  Nature,  467:967-971; Lee et al. (2012)  Nat. Immunol.,  13:991-999; Miossec et al. (2009)  N. Engl. J. Med.,  361:888-898; Miossec &amp; Kolls (2012)  Nat. Rev. Drug Discov.,  11:763-776; Zepp et al. (2011)  Trends Immunol.,  32:232-239). Although several transcription factors regulate T H 17, Î³/Î´ T and innate lymphoid cells as important sources of T H 17 cytokines, these cells are distinguished by its specific regulation of RORÎ³t for cytokine transcriptional output and effector functions and to a lesser extent by RORÎ± in humans (Cua &amp; Tato (2010)  Nat.

The patent in question is titled Production of stable non-polyadenylated RNAs.  The extract of text citing that article is: dress these issues as it generates in vivo stable transcripts that lack a poly-A tail. It is unlikely that transcripts with mMALAT1_3â€² sequences at their 3â€² ends interact with PABP since this protein requires at least 12 consecutive A residues for binding (Sachs et al. 1987). To demonstrate the utility of this system for investigating how non-polyadenylated transcripts are regulated in vivo, it was investigated whether microRNAs repress a transcript ending in the MALAT1 triple helix as efficiently as they do a polyadenylated transcript. MicroRNAs function as part of RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) and bind to partially complementary sites in target mRNAs, causing translational repression and/or transcript degradation (Bartel 2009). As the core RISC protein component GW182 can directly interact with PABP as well as deadenylases (Braun et al. 2011), a model has emerged in which an interaction between RISC and PABP is required for maximum repression by microRNAs (Fabian et al. 2009; Huntzinger et al. 2010; Moretti et al. 2012). However, the functional importance of these interactions has been debated (Fukaya and Tomari 2011; Mishima et al. 2012). 
     To investigate the role of the poly-A tail in microRNA-mediated repression in vivo, the two-color fluorescent reporter system was taken advantage of, and microRNA binding sites were inserted into the 3â€² UTR of mCherry, upstream of either the SV40 polyadenylation signal or the mMALAT1_3â€² region ( FIG. 7A ). In particular, either two bulged let-7 binding sites (denoted let-7 bg) or a sequence that is perfectly complementary to let-7 (denoted let-7 pf) were inserted, thus converting the interaction between target and microRNA into a catalytic, RNA interference-type repression. Using HeLa cells which naturally express let-7 microRNA, it was found that when mCherry ended in a canonical poly-A tail, the addition of two bulged let-7 binding sites caused 3.2+/âˆ’0.2-fold repression as measured by protein expression ( FIG. 7B  and  FIG. 16A ).

The patent in question is titled Assessing endothelial function and providing calibrated UFMD data using a blood pressure cuff.  The extract of text citing that article is: one (tension state of the arterial vascular smooth muscle). A fully dilated vessel cannot, by definition, exhibit additional dilation in response to a stimulus. Ideally, a stimulus such as nitroglycerin can be applied to assess the maximum dilation capacity of the vessel. However, when multiple measurements are performed on an individual over time, the natural variation of these states can be â€œlearnedâ€ by an algorithm. This may be used to obtain refined estimates of not only endothelial function, but also DBP and MAP, which are also substantially dependent on arterial tone, and, to a lesser extent, heart rate. By repeatedly applying protocols described above, a large portion of the characteristic curve: (luminal area change as a function of pulse pressure, as represented by the distension waveform recorded as pressure changes in the cuff) versus transmural pressure, is acquired under several different natural conditions. This enables an algorithm to learn this characteristic, which as Bank et al. (1999)  Circulation,  100: 41-47, have proven, is dependent on vessel tone. Specifically, the data obtained from the baseline recordings can improve measurements of SBP, DBP and MAP, regardless of the intactness of endothelial function in the mammal. The major effect of prevailing tone at the time of BP measurement, on values of DBP obtained via the oscillometric method, has been demonstrated by Babbs, and others. It is also known that these estimates are also dependent on pulse shape and heart rate. All of this information can be recorded in the baseline and post-stimulus pressure waveforms acquired by various embodiments of the invention described herein, and enables an algorithm to more accurately estimate both BP and endothelial function based on estimating the tone state of the vessel. 
     A fundamental advantage of the present methods over traditional measures of flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) is the increased sensitivity that comes from measuring parameters related to arterial cr",0.88

The patent in question is titled Substituted gemcitabine bicyclic amide analogs and treatment methods using same.  The extract of text citing that article is: errupt viral genome synthesis by being incorporated into a replicating virus genome to block further genome replication. 
     Again, without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, it is believed the disclosed compounds can also inhibit RNA virus replication through a second, additional mechanism. For example, gemcitabine also inhibits multiple steps within the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. The diphosphate form of gemcitabine (dFdCDP) inhibits ribonucleotide reductase while the triphosphate form (dFdCTP) inhibits both CTP synthetase and deoxycytidine monophosphate deaminase ( FIG. 2 ). The inhibition of these three enzymes leads to a reduction in cellular CTP and dCTP pools, and ultimately, an increase in the molar ratio of gemcitabine to natural nucleotides within cells. This ability of gemcitabine to reduce the cellular levels of competing natural pyrimidines and thereby increase the likelihood of incorporation of dFdCTP into DNA and RNA chains is termed â€œself-potentiationâ€ (Heinemann, V., et al. (1992)  Cancer Res  52, 533-539; Plunkett, W., et al. (1995)  Semin Oncol  22, 3-10; and Huang, P., et al. (1991)  Cancer Res  51, 6110-6117). It is believed that the disclosed compounds can inhibit the synthesis of RNA viruses indirectly by reducing intracellular CTP pools. Detrimental to its activity, gemcitabine is rapidly deaminated by cytidine deaminase both intracellularly and in plasma to yield the inactive metabolite 2â€²,2â€²-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU). Additionally, dFdCMP is deaminated intracellularly by deoxycytidylate deaminase to form the inactive metabolite dFdUMP. It is believed that protecting the amine group of the cytosine base of the disclosed compounds reduces inactivation of the compounds by deamination. 
     Interestingly, part of the current standard of care for patients diagnosed with chronic HCV is ribavirin, a nucleoside analog with broad spectrum antiviral activities. Although ribavirin has been proposed to inhibit viral replication through multiple mechanisms (Hon",0.07

The patent in question is titled Method of making primate cells expressing apelin receptor that have mesangioblast potential.  The extract of text citing that article is: iates into paraxial mesoderm, intermediate mesoderm, and lateral plate mesoderm. Paraxial mesoderm gives rise to axial skeleton, and skeletal muscles. Intermediate mesoderm forms the urogenital system. Lateral plate mesoderm gives rise to the circulatory system, including blood cells, vessels, and heart, and forms the viscera and limbs. Extraembryonic mesoderm is located outside the developing embryo. Evidence suggests that extraembryonic mesoderm is derived from the primitive streak during gastrulation (Boucher and Pedersen, Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 8:765 (1996)). Extraembryonic mesoderm gives rise to several tissues that provide the embryo with nutrients, a means of waste disposal, and mechanical protection. 
     Both lateral plate and extraembryonic mesoderm can generate endothelial and blood cells and express FOXF1, HAND1, HAND2, GATA-2, BMP4, and WNT5a, expression of which is low or undetectable in paraxial and intermediate mesoderm (Mahlapuu et al., Development. 128 (2):155 (2001); Firulli et al., Nat. Genet. 18 (3):266 (1998); Morikawa et al., Circ. Res. 103 (12):1422 (2008); Kelley et al., Dev. Biol. 165:193 (1994); Silver et al., Blood 89 (4):1154 (1997); Fujiwara et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 98 (24):13739 (2001); Takada et al., Genes Dev. 8 (2):174 (1994)). Distinctive markers for lateral plate and extraembryonic mesoderm remain to be elucidated. A recent finding by Bosse et al. suggests that IRX3 is expressed in lateral plate mesoderm but not in extraembryonic mesoderm (Bosse et al., Mech. Dev. 69 (1-2):169 (1997)). For the purposes of this application, the term lateral plate is used to describe both tissues.

     As shown in Scheme 12 compounds of Formula 1H (compound of Formula 1 wherein Y 1  is N, Y 2  is N, Y 3  is CR 1  and Y 4  is CR 1 ) can be prepared by the coupling of an alkyne with an azide of Formula 12. This type of reaction is commonly referred to as â€˜click chemistryâ€™ and well known to those skilled in the art. A review of suitable conditions and catalysts for the coupling of alkynes with azides (i.e. a compound of Formula 12) can be found in Meldal and Tornoe in  Chemical Reviews  2008, 108, 2952-3015 and references cited therein. Suitable conditions generally include a copper catalyst with ligands such as halides and ascorbate in a variety of organic solvents such as tert-butanol, methanol, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethyl formamide in addition to water.

     Peptide Epithelial Tight Junction Modulators 
     Peptide epithelial tight junction modulators can be used in the oral dosage forms of the invention. The oral dosage formulations of the invention can include a peptide epithelial tight junction modulator. The tight junction or zonula occludens (hereinafter â€œZOâ€) are one of the hallmarks of absorptive and secretory epithelia (Madara, J. Clin. Invest., 83:1089-1094 (1989); and Madara, Textbook of Secretory Diarrhea Eds, Lebenthal et al, Chapter 11, pages 125-138 (1990)). As a barrier between apical and basolateral compartments, they selectively regulate the passive diffusion of ions and water-soluble solutes through the paracellular pathway (Gumbiner, Am. J. Physiol., 253 (Cell Physiol. 22):C749-C758 (1987)). This barrier maintains any gradient generated by the activity of pathways associated with the transcellular route (Diamond, Physiologist, 20:10-18 (1977)). Variations in transepithelial conductance can usually be attributed to changes in the permeability of the paracellular pathway, since the resistances of enterocyte plasma membranes are relatively high. The ZO represents the major barrier in this paracellular pathway, and the electrical resistance of epithelial tissues depends on the number of transmembrane protein strands, and their complexity in the ZO, as observed by freeze-fracture electron microscopy (Madara et al, J. Cell Biol., 101:2124-",0.18

The patent in question is titled Screening methods.  The extract of text citing that article is: rapeutic agent. Examples of suitable polypeptide carriers include polylysine, polyglutamic acid, polyaspartic acid, co-polymers thereof, and mixed polymers of these amino acids and others, e.g., serines, to confer desirable solubility properties on the resultant loaded carrier and conjugate. 
     Alternatively, conjugated polypeptide binding agents can be prepared by directly conjugating a polypeptide binding agent component with a therapeutic agent. The general procedure is analogous to the indirect method of conjugation except that a therapeutic agent is directly attached to an oxidized polypeptide binding agent component. For example, a carbohydrate moiety of a polypeptide binding agent can be attached to polyethyleneglycol to extend half-life. 
     Alternatively, a therapeutic agent can be attached at the hinge region of a reduced antibody component via disulfide bond formation, or using a heterobifunctional cross-linker, such as N-succinyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)proprionate (SPDP). Yu et al., Int. J. Cancer 56:244 (1994). General techniques for such conjugation are well-known in the art. See, for example, Wong, Chemistry Of Protein Conjugation and Cross-Linking (CRC Press 1991); Upeslacis et al., â€œModification of Antibodies by Chemical Methods,â€ in Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Applications, Birch et al.

The patent in question is titled Method of treating myocardial infarction by administering a bi-specific fusion protein.  The extract of text citing that article is:  bind ( FIGS. 12A-12C and 13A-13B ), as shown in Example 6A. Next, to demonstrate that IGF1_mHSA_AnxV did not appreciably bind to cells via its IGF1 domain, the assays were repeated with the IGF1 blocking step.  FIGS. 14A-14C and 15A-15B  showed the binding of IGF1_mHSA_AnxV to apoptotic cells, even in the presence of, and after incubation with, excess IGF1. These data demonstrated that the AnxV targeting domain was responsible for the specific binding of protein fusions to apoptotic cells. 
     C. Specific Binding of AnxV_mHSA to Apoptotic ESC-Derived Cardiac Cells 
     AnxV_mHSA (SEQ ID 252) and AnxVm1234_mHSA (SEQ ID 250) were directly conjugated to Alex Fluor 647 (Alexa Fluor 647 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester, Invitrogen, A-20006) following the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Embryonic stem cell-derived (ESC-derived) cardiac cells (Peter Zandstra, University of Toronto) were derived essentially as described in Yang et al (Nature 2008, 453:524-8). Protocol was derived from Bauwens C L, et al., Tissue Eng Part A. 2011 Apr. 25, â€œGeometric Control of Cardiomyogenic Induction in Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.â€ Aggregate-based differentiation of hESCs was carried out using a protocol for serum-free directed differentiation to the cardiac lineage which has been previously described. HESC aggregate size was controlled by forced aggregation of defined cell concentrations in AggreWellâ„¢ inserts (STEMCELL Technologies) containing a textured surface of micro-wells. Briefly, a single cell suspension of feeder depleted hESCs was spun down into Aggrewells at a density of 1000 cells/micro-well.

The patent in question is titled Methods and compositions for producing double allele knock outs.  The extract of text citing that article is: ,  2003, 278(5):3466-3473). In ADCC, natural killer (NK) cells recognize the constant (Fc) region of antibodies primarily via interaction with the NK cell&#39;s FcÎ³RIII receptor, which then activates cell lysis and apoptosis. 
     The Fc-FcÎ³RIII interaction is extremely sensitive to Fc glycosylation. Aglycosylated antibodies, e.g., those produced by non-mammalian cell lines, fail to bind Fc receptors (Leatherbarrow et al.,  Mol. Immun.,  1985, 22:407-15; Walker et al.,  Biochem. J.,  1989, 259:347-53; Leader et al.,  Immunology,  1991, 72:481-5). On the other hand, fucosylation of the carbohydrate chain attached to Asn297 of the Fc region reduces binding to FcÎ³RIII and reduces in vitro ADCC activity (Shields et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.,  2002, 277:26733-40; Shinkawa et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.,  2003, 278:3466-73; Niwa et al.,  Cancer Res.,  2004, 64:2127-33). 
     The majority of mammalian immunoglobulins are fucosylated, including those produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO cells) (Jefferis et al.,  Biochem J.,  1990, 268:529-37; Raju et al.,  Glycobiology,  2000, 10:477-86). Fucose is attached to the Fc core region via an a-1,6 linkage generated by the Î±-1,6 fucosyltransferase (FUT8) protein (Oriol et al.,  Glycobiology,  1999, 9:323-34; Costache et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.,  1997, 272:29721-8). Disruption of the Fut8 gene in CHO cells can eliminate core fucosylation of antibodies and can increase ADCC Ëœ100 folds (Yamane-Ohnuki et al.,  Biotech. Bioengin.,  2004, 87(5):614-622). 
     Genome editing has been used to reduce or eliminate FUT8 activity by knocking down or knocking out both Fut8 alleles. Imai-Nishiya et al. have disclosed the double knock-down of Fut8 and GMD, using a siRNA tandem expression vector for targeting these genes and introducing it into IgG1 antibody-producing CHO/DG44 32-05-12 cells ( BMC Biotechnology,  2007, 7:84; doi:10.1186/1472-6750-7-84).

The promoter can be any suitable distance upstream of the encoded gene. 
     In some embodiments, the subject polynucleotide cassette comprises a sequence encoding a 5â€² untranslated region, i.e. polynucleotide sequence encoding an untranslated region 5â€² to the coding sequence, also called the 5â€²UTR. In an expression cassette, the 5â€²UTR is known in the art as the sequence between the transcription initiation site and the Kozak sequence where protein translation begins. Secondary mRNA structure of the 5â€²UTR is known to affect transcription levels. Specifically, for enhanced gene expression, the sequence of the 5â€²UTR region in the present invention is selected to minimize or avoid secondary structures and upstream AUG (uAUG) codons which are known to decrease translation efficiency due to inefficient ribosome scanning and false translational starts (Kozak, 1995. PNAS 92:2662). See Davuluri et al., Genome Research, 2000: 10 (11); 1807-1816. For example, the 5â€²UTR sequence from the human gene HSP70 (SEQ ID NO:58) has been identified for its unusual ability to enhance mRNA translation, possibly due to an IRES mechanism (Rubtsova et al., 2003. PNAS 278(25): 22350-22356; Vivinus et al, 2001. Eur J Biochem. 268: 1908-1917). Any 5â€² UTR can be used, but ideally the sequence of the 5â€²UTR has minimal secondary mRNA structure and upstream AUG sequences. Put another way, in some embodiments, the sequence between the transcription initiation site and the translation initiation site of the polynucleotide cassette does not contain the polynucleotide ATG. In some embodiments, the 5â€² UTR comprises, consists essentially, or consists of SEQ ID NO:56, SEQ ID NO:57, SEQ ID NO:58, SEQ ID NO:84, SEQ ID NO:85, SEQ ID NO:86, SEQ ID NO:87, SEQ ID NO:88, or SEQ ID NO:89; or a functional fragment or variant thereof, for example, a polynucleotide sequence having a seque",0.92

     Reverse Transcription Assay Formulation. 
     Three of the pathogens in the final reaction cocktail had RNA genomes: Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus (VEE), Marburg virus (MV), and Ebola virus (EV) In order to amplify the two targets associated with each of these pathogens, a reverse transcription (RT) step was necessary. To reduce the number of oligonucleotide primers present in the final RT reaction cocktail, all RT reactions utilized the reverse PCR primer as the first strand synthesis primer. This method of cDNA synthesis should also convey another level of specificity as only cDNA templates specific for the target of interest will be synthesized. 
     During preliminary studies of RT conditions, we found that the presence of reverse transcriptase can have severe inhibitory effects on subsequent PCR reactions. This effect is known (Sellner L N et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 1992, 20, 1487-90) and is usually avoided by diluting the RT product before performing PCR, a procedure that would complicate processing in a cartridge format. Instead of diluting the RT product, we were able to eliminate the effect of RT on the PCR reaction by minimizing the amount of reverse transcriptase in the RT mixture and adding tRNA to the reaction mixture. To test RT interference on DNA amplification, we took a DNA target (FT) and processed it using the full RT and PCR protocol. We tested both a one step RT&amp;PCR protocol (all primers present through RT and PCR steps) and a two step RT&amp;PCR protocol (only reverse PCR primers for RNA targets present during RT step).  FIG. 15  shows that addition of tRNA completely reverses the inhibitory effect of RT enzyme on PCR (see Panel B). Panel A shows the amplification of a DNA target (FT) using our 16-plex primer mix and a one step RT and PCR protocol (all primers for DNA and RNA targets present during RT step).

     Scheme 13 describes the synthesis of anilines XLVI and XLIX. A Sonogashira coupling of XXVIII/XV with ethynyltrimethylsilane followed by removal of the silyl group using a mild base (such as potassium carbonate in a protic solvent such as methanol) or a fluoride source (such as tetrabutylammonium fluoride or potassium fluoride) can be used to provide the terminal alkynes XLVI and XLVII. The Sonogashira coupling is performed using a palladium catalyst (such as tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium), a copper catalyst such as copper(I) iodide, and a base (typically an amine base such as triethylamine or diisopropylamine) using either the base as the solvent or a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide; however, a great deal of work has been done running the reaction with different ligands and additives and even in the absence of the catalysts, see: Chinchilla, R.,  Chem.

The patent in question is titled Diagnostic markers for treating cell proliferative disorders with telomerase inhibitors.  The extract of text citing that article is: d the Strategy of Nucleic Acid Assays,â€ in  Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology: Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes , Vol 24, Elsevier Publishers, Amsterdam (1993). Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5-10Â° C. lower than the thermal melting point (i.e., T m ) for a specific hybrid at a defined temperature under a defined solution condition at which 50% of the probe or primer is hybridized to the target nucleic acid at equilibrium. Since the degree of stringency is generally determined by the difference in the hybridization temperature and the T m , a particular degree of stringency may be maintained despite changes in solution condition of hybridization as long as the difference in temperature from T m  is maintained. The hybridization conditions may also vary with the type of nucleic acid backbone, for example ribonucleic acid or peptide nucleic acid backbone. 
     In another aspect, telomere lengths can be measured by flow cytometry (Hultdin, M. et al.,  Nucleic Acids Res.  26: 3651-3656 (1998); Rufer, N. et al.,  Nat. Biotechnol.  16:743-747 (1998); incorporated herein by reference). Flow cytometry methods are variations of FISH techniques. If the starting material is tissue, a cell suspension is made, generally by mechanical separation and/or treatment with proteases. Cells are fixed with a fixative and hybridized with a telomere sequence specific probe, preferably a PNA probe, labeled with a fluorescent label. Following hybridization, cell are washed and then analyzed by FACS. Fluorescence signal is measured for cells in G o /G 1  following appropriate subtraction for background fluorescence. This technique is suitable for rapid estimation of telomere length for large numbers of samples. Similar to TRF, telomere length is the average length of telomeres within the cell. 
     In other aspects, the average length of telomeres from cells within a biological sample is determined via quantitative PCR (qPCR) or telomere fluorescent in situ hybridization (telo-FISH).

The patent in question is titled Monoclonal antibodies directed against trimeric forms of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein with broad and potent neutralizing activity.  The extract of text citing that article is: specific anti-ErbB2/anti-FcÎ³RIII antibody and U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,234 discloses a bispecific anti-ErbB2/anti-FcÎ³RI antibody. A bispecific anti-ErbB2/FcÎ± antibody is shown in WO98/02463. U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337 teaches a bispecific anti-ErbB2/anti-CD3 antibody. 
     Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities (Millstein et al., Nature, 305:537-539 (1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of ten different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule, which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93/08829, and in Traunecker et al., EMBO J., 10:3655-3659 (1991). 
     According to a different approach, antibody variable regions with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. Preferably, the fusion is with an Ig heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, C H 2, and C H 3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant region (C H 1) containing the site necessary for light chain bonding, present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host cell. This provides for greater flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yield of the desired bispecific antibody. It is, however, possible to insert the codi",0.53

The patent in question is titled Nonlinear system identification for optimization of wireless power transfer.  The extract of text citing that article is: inear Biological Systems: LNL Cascade Models, Biological Cybernetics, vol. 55, pp. 125-34, (1986). It has been demonstrated that every continuous discrete time system with finite memory can be uniformly approximated by a finite sum of LNL systems. 
     The nonparametric functions implemented numerically end up being represented as sampled functions and involve a very large number of numerical values. Therefore, often these sampled data functions are converted to a parametric form. In this way, the efficiency of computation is preserved and the final representation ends up being more parsimonious. In many cases, after inspection of the impulse response the order of the system may be inferred and after fitting a simplified reduced-order model the impulse response ends up being filtered and less noisy. 
     Additional explication of the use of nonlinear system identification, with respect, more particularly, to Wiener and Volterra kernels, may also be found in the following references: Korenberg, et al., Exact Orthogonal Kernel Estimation From Finite Data Records: Extending Wiener&#39;s Identification Of Nonlinear Systems, Annals of Biomedical Engineering, vol. 16, pp. 201-14 (1988); Korenberg, et al., The Identification of Nonlinear Biological Systems: Wiener Kernel Approaches, Annals of Biomedical Engineering, vol. 18, pp. 629-54 (1990); and Korenberg, et al., The Identification of Nonlinear Biological Systems: Volterra Kernel Approaches, Annals of Biomedical Engineering, vol. 24, pp. 250-68 (1996).

The extract of text citing that article is: r functions is difficult since the virus is strictly species specific and no animal model system is available. However, murine CMV and guinea pig CMV have been used to evaluate vaccine strategies in these host species. 
     A CMV vaccine that induces both protective T cell and neutralizing antibody responses has the potential to prevent infection or ameliorate CMV disease due to congenital infection or transplantation. 
     The first live, attenuated HCMV vaccine candidate tested in humans was based on the laboratory-adapted AD169 strain. Subsequent trials with another laboratory-adapted clinical isolate, the Towne strain, confirmed that live attenuated vaccines could elicit neutralizing antibodies, as well as CD4 +  and CD8 +  T lymphocyte responses. The efficacy of the Towne vaccine was assessed in a series of studies in renal transplant recipients. Although the Towne vaccine did provide a protective impact on HCMV disease it failed to prevent HCMV infection after transplantation (Plotkin S A et al., 1984 Lancet 1:528-530). Towne vaccine was also evaluated in a placebo-controlled study of seronegative mothers who had children attending group daycare where it failed to prevent these women from acquiring infection from their HCMV-infected children (Adler S P et al., 1995 J Infectious Diseases 171:26-32). An interpretation of these studies was that the Towne vaccine was overattenuated. To explore this possibility a series of genetic recombinants in which regions of the unattenuated â€œToledoâ€ strain of CMV were substituted for the corresponding regions of the Towne genome, resulting in the construction of Towne/Toledo â€œchimerasâ€ that contain some, but not all, of the mutations that contribute to the Towne vaccine attenuation (Heineman T C et al. 2006 J Infect Disease 193:1350-1360).

The patent in question is titled Recombinant deamidated gliadin antigen.  The extract of text citing that article is:  the analysis of a large number of samples. Nevertheless AGA are less specific for CD than endomysal antibodies (EMA) and the detection of antibodies to either IgA or IgG isotypes requires two independent assays. Recently a visual immunoassay for the detection of AGA, which solves some of these problems, has been reported (Garrote J A, Sorell L, Alfonso P et al 1999. A simple visual immunoassay for the screening of coeliac disease. Eur. J Clin Invest 29; 697-699; Spanish Office for Patents and Marks No. 9801067). 
     In 1997, Dietrich et al. identified tissue transglutaminase (tTG), an 85 kDa protein, as the major auto antigen detected by anti-endomysial antibodies (Dietrich W et al. 1997. Identification of tissue transglutaminase as the auto antigen of celiac disease. Nat Med. 3:797-801). Detection of anti-tTG antibodies had been reported lately in ELISA or radio-ligand (RLA) formats based on tTG from guinea pig liver extracts or recombinant human tTG cloned from different tissues (Sulkanen S et al. 1998. Tissue transglutaminase autoantibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in detecting celiac disease. Gastroenterology 115:1322-1328; Siessler J et al. 1999. Antibodies to human recombinant tissue transglutaminase measured by radioligand assay: Evidence for high diagnostic sensitivity for celiac disease. Horm Metab Res 31; 375-379). 
     Prior art methods for detection of celiac disease use specific gliadin epitopes or pieces of the gliadin protein in an assay, that lead to both false-negatives and false-positives. What is needed is an assay that provides new antigens containing a more inclusive set of epitopes that provides a more accurate assay for celiac disease. Surprisingly, the present invention meets this and other needs.

The patent in question is titled Pro-drug form (P2PDox) of the highly potent 2-pyrrolinodoxorubicin conjugated to antibodies for targeted therapy of cancer.  The extract of text citing that article is: yne group attached to a first molecule. In the presence of a second molecule comprising an azide moiety, the azide reacts with the activated alkyne to form a 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole. The copper catalyzed reaction occurs at room temperature and is sufficiently specific that purification of the reaction product is often not required. (Rostovstev et al., 2002, Angew Chem Int Ed 41:2596; Tornoe et al., 2002, J Org Chem 67:3057.) The azide and alkyne functional groups are largely inert towards biomolecules in aqueous medium, allowing the reaction to occur in complex solutions. The triazole formed is chemically stable and is not subject to enzymatic cleavage, making the click chemistry product highly stable in biological systems. Although the copper catalyst is toxic to living cells, the copper-based click chemistry reaction may be used in vitro for immunoconjugate formation. 
     A copper-free click reaction has been proposed for covalent modification of biomolecules. (See, e.g., Agard et al., 2004, J Am Chem Soc 126:15046-47.) The copper-free reaction uses ring strain in place of the copper catalyst to promote a [3+2] azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction (Id.) For example, cyclooctyne is an 8-carbon ring structure comprising an internal alkyne bond. The closed ring structure induces a substantial bond angle deformation of the acetylene, which is highly reactive with azide groups to form a triazole. Thus, cyclooctyne derivatives may be used for copper-free click reactions (Id.) 
     Another type of copper-free click reaction was reported by Ning et al. (2010, Angew Chem Int Ed 49:3065-68), involving strain-promoted alkyne-nitrone cycloaddition. To address the slow rate of the original cyclooctyne reaction, electron-withdrawing groups are attached adjacent to the triple bond (Id.) Examples of such substituted cyclooctynes include difluorinated cyclooctynes, 4-dibenzocyclooctynol and azacyclooctyne (Id.)

Fukuda, M. Konarova,  Powder Technol.,  181 (3), 228 (2008). This multi-step path offers the advantage of relatively large secondary particle, but the particles consist of multiple fragments with no bonding connection or structural strength. Although this problem may be overcome by the addition of a binder to the sprayed solution, the binder itself may act as a contaminant in the product and may prevent intimate contact between fragments. 
     Still further, limited amounts of nanoparticles have been included in the precursor solution to serve as seeds that promote heterogeneous nucleation during the pyrolysis stage. â€œPhotoluminescence optimization of luminescent nanocomposites fabricated by spray pyrolysis of a colloid-solution precursor,â€ W.

Furthermore, this method incorporates a large volume of non-active colloids into the final product, which is an undesirable feature for most applications.

     VLPs can also be designed from variants of the yeast totivirus L-A (see Powilleit et al. (2007)  PLOS One  2(5):e415). The Pol gene of the L-A virus can be replaced with an appropriate antigen to induce a specific immune response, demonstrating that yeast VLPs are effective antigen carriers. 
     Recombinant, nonreplicative parvovirus-like particles can also be used as antigen carriers. (Sedlik, et al. (1997) PNAS 94:7503-7508.) These particles allow the carried antigens into the cytosol so they enter the class I-restricted immunological pathway, thus stimulating cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) mediated responses. Sedlik specifically used PPV:VLP, which contained the VP2 capsid protein of the parvovirus and residues 118-132 from the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) was inserted into the VP2 capsid protein. The PPV:VLP containing LCMV was capable of inducing an immune response to LCMV and elicited immunological protection against lethal viral doses in pre-immunized mice. 
     VLPs can also comprise replication incompetent influenza that lack the influenza NS2 gene, the gene essential for viral replication. (Watanabe, et al. (1996)  J. Virol.  76(2):767-773.) These VLPs infect mammalian cells and allow expression of foreign proteins. 
     Norwalk virus (NV)-based VLPs can also be used as vehicles for immunogen delivery. (Ball, et al. (1999)  Gastroenterology  117:40-48.) The NV geno",0.89

     Example 1â€”Molecular Biology 
     A third-generation, SIV-based, pro-lentiviral vector was used (Hanawa et al., 2004, Blood, 103:4062-9). Sequences containing a 476-bp human synapsin-1 promoter element, GCaMP3 coding region, an EMCV internal ribosome entry site, a nuclear localization tag fused to mCherry, a woodchuck hepatitis post-transcriptional regulatory element, and a rabbit beta-globin poly-adenylation signal were inserted between LTRs. GCaMP variants were constructed by PCR of the coding region using mutagenic primers. Mutated coding regions were then inserted into the pro-lentiviral vector by ligation-independent cloning.

The patent in question is titled Methods and devices for minimally-invasive delivery of radiation to the eye.  The extract of text citing that article is: f about 20 Gy is delivered to the target. In some embodiments, a dose of about 24 Gy is delivered to the target. In some embodiments, a dose of about 20 Gy to 24 Gy is delivered to the target. In some embodiments, a dose of about 30 Gy is delivered to the target. In some embodiments, about 24 Gy to 30 Gy is delivered to the target.

In some embodiments, a dose of about 75 Gy is delivered to the target. 
     Dose Rates 
     The medical radiation community believes as medico-legal fact that low dose rate irradiation (e.g., less than about 10 Gy/min) is preferred over high dose rate irradiation because high dose rate irradiation may cause more complications. For example, the scientific publication â€œPosttreatment Visual Acuity in Patients Treated with Episcleral Plaque Therapy for Choroidal Melanomas: Dose and Dose Rate Effectsâ€ (Jones, R., Gore, E., Mieler, W., Murray, K., Gillin, M., Albano, K., Erickson, B., International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics, Volume 52, Number 4, pp. 989-995, 2002) reported the result â€œmacula dose rates of 111 cGy/h (+/âˆ’11.1 cGy/h) were associated with a 50% risk of significant visual loss,â€ leading them to conclude â€œhigher dose rates to the macula correlated strongly with poorer posttreatment visual outcome.â€ Furthermore, the American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) issued their recommendations in the scientific publication, â€œThe American Brachytherapy Society Recommendations for Brachytherapy of Uveal Melanomasâ€ (Nag, S., Quivey, J. M., Earle, J. D., Followill, D., Fontanesi, J., and Finger, P. T., International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics, Volume 56, Number 2, pp. 544-555, 2003) stating â€œthe ABS recommends a minimum tumor I-125 dose of 85 Gy at a dose rate of 0.60 to 1.05 Gy/h using AAPM TG-43 formalism for the calculation of dose.â€ Thus, the medical standard of care requires low dose rates.

The patent in question is titled Aryl ethers and uses thereof.  The extract of text citing that article is: protein binds to the specific hydroxylated proline residues and recruits E3 ubiquition-ligase complex that targets HIF-Î± proteins for proteasomal degradation. Because PHDs require oxygen to function, under hypoxic conditions, HIF-Î± proteins accumulate and enter the nucleus to activate gene expression. Genetic mutations of the VHL gene that result in loss of function lead to constitutively active HIF-Î± proteins regardless of oxygen levels. Upon activation, these transcription factors stimulate the expression of genes that coordinately regulate anaerobic metabolism, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, cell survival, extracellular matrix remodeling, pH homeostasis, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, and genomic instability. While many gene products involved in the hypoxic response have been explored individually as therapeutic targets for cancer, broad inhibition of the pathway through direct targeting of HIF-Î± proteins offers an exciting opportunity to attack tumors on multiple fronts (Keith, et al.  Nature Rev. Cancer  12: 9-22, 2012). 
     Both HIF-1Î± and HIF-2Î± form a dimeric complex with HIF-1Î² (or ARNT: aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator) and subsequently bind to hypoxia response elements (HRE) in target genes. Because the level of HIF-1Î² is unaffected by oxygen levels or VHL, transcriptional activity of the complex is largely driven by the availability of the HIF-Î± proteins. While HIF-1Î± and HIF-2Î± share significant sequence homology, they differ in tissue distribution, sensitivity to hypoxia, timing of activation and target gene specificity (Hu, et al.  Mol. Cell Biol.  23: 9361-9374, 2003 and Keith, et al.  Nature Rev. Cancer  12: 9-22, 2012). Whereas HIF-1Î± mRNA is ubiquitously expressed, the expression of HIF-2Î± mRNA is found primarily in kidney fibroblasts, hepatocytes and intestinal lumen epithelial cells. Consistent with the tight regulation of the HIF-Î± proteins under normal physiology, neither is detected in normal tissue with the exception of HIF-2Î± in macrophages (Talks, et al.  Am. J.",0.97

In some embodiments, the cupredoxin derived peptide may comprise such modifications to enhance Î±-helix content. 
     Another method to stabilize an Î±-helix tertiary structure is the all-carbon cross-link method. The all-hydrocarbon cross-link method is proven to increase the stabilization of helical structure, protease resistant and cell-permeability. Walensky et al., Science, 305, 1466-1470 (2004). Î±,Î±-disubstituted non-natural amino acids containing olefin-bearing tethers are incorporated into peptides.

     BACKGROUND 
       Plasmodium  is the causative agent of malaria, one of the world&#39;s deadliest parasitic diseases. Malaria affects over 300 million people worldwide, causing more than 1 million deaths annually, particularly in young children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, there is no vaccine available, and there is widespread resistance to common anti-malarial drugs. RTS,S, a leading vaccine candidate which targets the initial infection of the liver, achieved only partial efficacy (Olotu, et al. 2013  N Engl J Med  368(12):1111-1120). However, clinical manifestations of the disease are caused by the blood-stage parasites. These disease-causing forms of the parasite primarily reside within the red blood cells (RBC), which, upon maturation (schizont), releases merozoites, the invasive form of  Plasmodium  that invades new RBCs. Therefore, vaccines targeting the erythrocytic forms of the parasite are desirable for efficient disease control measures. 
     Apicomplexan parasites have specialized secretory organelles (rhoptries and micronemes) that release their contents during host cell invasion. The micronemes possess the protein apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1). AMA1 is an essential merozoite surface protein and was previously considered one of the leading blood-stage vaccine candidates (Stowers, et al. 2002  Infect Immun  70(12):6961-6967 and Dutta, et al. (2009)  PLoS One  4(12):e8138). Despite the vaccines&#39; ability to elicit high-titred AMA1-specific antibodies, Phase 2 clini",0.01

The patent in question is titled Heterodimeric immunoglobulins.  The extract of text citing that article is: ct binding of the antibody containing the heavy chains to one or more Fc receptors. One of the functions of the Fc portion of an antibody is to communicate to the immune system when the antibody binds its target. This is commonly referenced as â€œeffector function.â€ Communication leads to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and/or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). ADCC and ADCP are mediated through the binding of the Fc to Fc receptors on the surface of cells of the immune system. CDC is mediated through the binding of the Fc with proteins of the complement system, e.g., Clq. 
     In addition, the heterodimeric antibodies described herein may have amino acid modifications in the constant region to modify effector function of the antibody, including half-life or clearance, ADCC and/or CDC activity. Such modifications can enhance pharmacokinetics or enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of the antibody, for example. See Shields et al., J. Biol. Chem., 276(9):6591-6604 (2001), incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. 
     The IgG subclasses vary in their ability to mediate effector functions. For example, IgG1 is superior to IgG2 and IgG4 at mediating ADCC and CDC. The effector function of an antibody can be increased, or decreased, by introducing one or more mutations into the Fc. Embodiments of the invention include heterodimeric antibodies, having an Fc engineered to increase effector function (U.S. Pat. No. 7,317,091 and Strohl, Curr. Opin. Biotech., 20:685-691, 2009; both incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).

The patent in question is titled Universal methylation profiling methods.  The extract of text citing that article is: ns (0.2 N sodium hydroxide at elevated temperature for several hours). Under these conditions bisulfite conversion and chain breakage are competing reactions, and bisulfite conversion only approaches completion when &gt;95% of the DNA has been cleaved to less than 350 bp (Warnecke at al., 2002). This means that large amounts of starting DNA must be used and the DNA must be long. This prevents the use of DNA from paraffin sections, where the DNA is almost all &lt;300 bp, and also prevents the use of small amounts of DNA, as in the case of early embryos, small tissue biopsies, and other cases in which large amounts of DNA are not available. Third. CpG dinucleotides in certain sequence contexts are inherently resistant to bisulfite conversion (Warnecke et al., 2002), and are scored as spurious sites of methylation. Fourth, the loss of all C-G base pairs introduces a large bias in the PCR amplification step in favor of PCR product derived from unconverted or methylated starting material. (Warnecke at al., 1997). Each of these artifacts can be severe. 
     Together the loss of sequence information upon bisulfite conversion, the strong PCR biases, the artifacts of bisulfite conversion, and the need for large amounts of long starting DNA renders conventional BGS inappropriate for whole-genome methylation profiling by ultrahigh throughput DNA sequencing. 
     Over the past few years this laboratory has developed new methods to fractionate the normal human genome into methylated and unmethylated compartments and have determined the methylation status of CpG dinucleotides in excess of 30 million base pairs from the fractionated genomes in order to characterize the methylation landscape of the normal human genome (Rollins et al., 2006). In that work, new computational methods were developed that mapped annotated features of the genome onto very large assemblages of sequence data. Although this method, which depends on the enzymatic fractionation of DNA into methylated and unmethylated compartmen",0.84

The patent in question is titled Compositions and methods for non-invasive imaging.  The extract of text citing that article is: d chelator (4-DEAP-ATSC) and a  64 Cu chelation complex ( 64 Cu:4-DEAP-ATSC) (herein after, â€œLiposome Aâ€). 4-DEAP-ATSC is derived from the ATSM structure by adding two diethylamino(propyl) groups (compare structures in  FIGS. 1 and 2 ).  64 Cu-ATSM (see structure in  FIG. 2 ) is currently being clinically tested as a PET imaging agent in cancer patients. 4-DEAP-ATSC is similar to ATSM in that it retains the  64 Cu chelating activity of ATSM; however, it has the unexpected property of being rapidly entrapped within PEGylated liposomes containing a chemical gradient, thereby creating a liposomal imaging agent, as described above. 
     Example 7: Effect of Liposome Targeting on Tumor Deposition 
     Preclinical studies have examined the effect of liposome targeting on total tumor deposition. These studies have shown that the targeting of PEGylated liposomes to the HER2 receptor on tumors did not affect its pharmacokinetics or overall tumor deposition compared to an untargeted liposome. Kirpotin et al labeled liposomes with  67 Ga and showed similar tumor deposition % injected dose per gram (% i.d./g) for a HER2-targeted liposome and a corresponding untargeted liposome ( Cancer Research  (66)6732 (2006). Similar results were obtained by comparing tumor deposition by HER2-targeted Liposome B and untargeted liposomes (disclosed in co-pending Patent Application Serial No. PCT/US2011/064496) in an NCI-N87 (ATCCÂ® #CRL-5822â„¢) gastric carcinoma mouse xenograft model, as well as in BT474-M3 breast carcinoma mouse xenograft model in which the two liposome formulations only result in difference in tumor cell uptake ( FIG. 25  insert) with no significant difference detected in total liposome deposition in the tumors ( FIG. 25 ).  FIG. 26  further illustrates that liposome targeting does not have any obvious effect on tumor deposition as no correlation can be established between tumor depositions of Liposome B in tumors with varying HER2 expression. Similarly, in the BT474-M3 tumor model (HER2-overexpressing tumors), the HER2-targeted liposome B were shown to have similar tumor deposition as the non-targeted liposome A

Suitable channeling devices comprise for example, a valve actuator and a cylindrical or cone-like passage through which medicament can be delivered from the filled canister via the metering valve to the nose or mouth of a patient such as a mouthpiece actuator. 
     The term â€œmicroRNAâ€ or â€œmiRNAâ€ as used herein refers to its meaning as is generally accepted in the art. The term generally refers to a small non-coding RNA that regulates the expression of target messenger RNAs either by mRNA cleavage, translational repression/inhibition or heterochromatic silencing (see for example Ambros, 2004, Nature, 431, 350-355; Bartel, 2004, Cell, 116, 281-297; Cullen, 2004, Virus Research, 102, 3-9; He et al., 2004, Nat.

The patent in question is titled Humaneered anti-factor B antibody.  The extract of text citing that article is: :26-32). It is well documented that glycosylation patterns of antibodies can differ depending on the producing cell and the cell culture conditions (Raju,  BioProcess International  2003, 44-53). Such differences can lead to changes in both effector function and pharmacokinetics (Israel et al.,  Immunology  1996, 89(4):573-578; Newkirk et al.,  Clin Exp Immunol  1996, 106(2):259-64). In addition, the presence or absence of fucose in the oligosaccharide component of an IgG can improve binding and ADCC (Shields et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.  2002; 277(30):26733-40). An IgG that lacked a fucosylated carbohydrate linked to Asn 297  exhibited normal receptor binding to the FcÎ³R1. In contrast, binding to the FcÎ³RIIIA receptor was improved up to 50-fold and accompanied by enhanced ADCC, especially at lower antibody concentrations. 
     Glycosylation is often species- and cell-specific, and is determined as well by the structure of the protein backbone and the carbohydrate attachment site. Work by Shinkawa et al. demonstrated that an antibody to the human IL-5 receptor produced in a rat hybridoma showed more than 50-fold higher ADCC when compared to the antibody produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) (Shinkawa et al.,  J Biol Chem.  2003, 278(5):3466-73). Monosaccharide composition and oligosaccharide profiling showed that the rat hybridoma-produced IgG had a lower content of fucose than the CHO-produced protein. The authors concluded that the lack of fucosylation of an IgG1 has a critical role in enhancement of ADCC activity. 
     One aspect of the present invention provides antibodies which are modified in their glycosylation patterns. The altered glycosylation may include, for example, a decrease in the number of glycosylated amino acid residues or a change in the pattern or location of glycosylated residues. In some embodiments, the glycosylation in the variable region is altered. 
     The modification of the glycosylation of native antibodies can be obtained through different methods known in the art. Modification of the glycosylation pattern in the antigen binding site of the antibodies of the present invention can be achieved by enzymatic treatment of purified antibodies. Alternatively, modification of the gl",0.98

This disorder is a form of angiopathy in which the same AÎ² deposits as found in AD accumulate in the walls of the leptomeninges and superficial cerebral cortical blood vessels of the brain. Amyloid deposition predisposes these blood vessels to failure, increasing the risk of a hemorrhagic stroke.

     Both PKC-Î± and PKC-Ïµ are important for synaptogenesisâ€”i.e., the formation of synapses. The high abundance of PKC-Ïµ in presynaptic nerve fibers suggests a role in neurite outgrowth, synaptic formation, and neurotransmitter release. See Shirai et al.,  FEBS,  2008, 29: 1445-1453.

See Nelson et al.,  Trends Biochem. Sci.,  2009, 34: 136-145; Hongpaisan et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,  2007, 104: 19571-19576; Sun et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

     For example, PKC activators have demonstrated neuroprotective activity in animal models of stroke. See Sun et al.,  Eur. J. Pharmacol.,  2005, 512: 43-51. Several PKC isoforms play a central role in mediating ischemic and reperfusion damage following stroke. Studies with experimental stroke models, mouse genetics, and selective peptide inhibitors and activators have demonstrated that PKC-Ïµ is involved in induction of ischemic tolerance and prevents damage, while PKC-Î´ and PKC-Î³ are implicated in injury. See Takayoshi et al.,  Stroke,  2007, 38(2): 375-380; and Bright et al.,  Stroke,  2005; 36: 2781. Postischemic/hypoxic treatment with Bryostatin-1 effectively rescued ischemia-induced deficits in synaptogenesis, neurotrophic activity, and spatial learning and memory. See Sun et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA.,  2008, 105(36): 13620-13625.

The patent in question is titled Age-related macular degeneration treatment.  The extract of text citing that article is: omplex (RISC) through binding to a member of the Argonaute protein family. After integration into the RISC, the guide strand base-pairs with its target mRNA and is thought to either inhibit a target by inhibiting translation (by stalling the translational machinery) and/or inducing cleavage of the mRNA, thereby preventing it from being used as a translation template. 
     While the fragments produced by Dicer are double-stranded, only the guide strand, directs gene silencing. The anti-guide strand (referred to commonly as a passenger strand, carrier strand or * strand) is frequently degraded during RISC activation (Gregory R et al., 2005). RISC assembly is thought to be governed by an enzyme that selects which strand of a dsRNA Dicer product is loaded into RISC. This strand is usually the one whose 5â€² end is less tightly paired to its complement. There also appears to be a clear bias for A, and to a lesser extent U, at the 5â€² position to facilitate binding to some Argonaute proteins (Schwarz D S et al., 2003; Frank F et al., 2010).

The extract of text citing that article is: stimulates glucose metabolism associtated with tumor cell growth by various interactions with PFKFB3, ENTPD5, mTOR and TSC2 (a.k.a., tuberin). Id. 
     Transcription factors HIF1 and HIF2 are largely responsible for cellular response to low oxygen conditions often associated with tumors. Id. Once activated, HIF1 promotes tumor cell capacity to carry out glycolysis. Id. Thus, inhibition of HIF1 may slow or reverse tumor cell metabolism. Activation of HIF1 has been linked to PI3K, tumor suppressor proteins such as VHL, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and fumarate hydratase. Id. The oncogenic transcription factor MYC has also been linked to tumor cell metabolism, specifically glycolysis. Id. MYC also promotes cell proliferation by glutamine metabolic pathways. Id. 
     AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) functions as a metabolic check point which tumor cells must overcome in order to proliferate. Id. Several mutations have been identified which suppress AMPK signaling in tumor cells. See Shackelford, D. B. &amp; Shaw, R. J.,  Nature Rev. Cancer,  2009, 9: 563-575. STK11 has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene related to the role of AMPK. See Cairns, R. A., et al.  Nature Rev.,  2011, 11:85-95. 
     The transcription factor p53, a tumor suppressor, also has an important role in the regulation of cellular metabolism. Id. The loss of p53 in tumor cells may be a significant contributor to changes in tumor cell metabolism to the glycolytic pathway. Id. The OCT1 transcription factor, another potential target for chemotherapeutics, may cooperate with p53 in regulating tumor cell metabolism. Id. 
     Pyruvate kinate M2 (PKM2) promotes changes in cellular metabolism which confer metabolic advantages to cancer cells by supporting cell proliferation. Id. For example, lung cancer cells which express PKM2 over PKM1 have been found to have such an advantage. Id. In the clinic, PKM2 has been identified as being overexpressed in a number of cancer types.

Science  2007, 318, 1618-1622. 
     Preparation of functionalized F-POSS molecules has been achieved with limited success. Early approaches involved the preparation of incompletely condensed silsesquioxanes. The most effective early approaches have involved the opening of completely condensed POSS cage edges by acid catalysis and isolation of disilanol fluorinated polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (F-POSS-(OH) 2 ). The isolated F-POSS-(OH) 2  molecule has been subsequently treated with dichlorosilanes of the type Cl 2 SiR 1 R 2  to produce functionalized F-POSS structures. See, Ramirez, S. M.; Diaz, Y. J.; Campos, R.; Stone, R. L.; Haddad, T. S.; Mabry, J. M.  J. Am. Chem. Soc.,  2011, 133, 20084-20087. A major drawback of such approaches is the difficulty in isolating the desired disilanol. Without being bound by theory, it is postulated that the completely condensed F-POSS cage exists in equilibrium with the ring-opened disilanol product under acidic conditions. Accordingly, the ring-opened disilanol is constantly undergoing condensation to the lower energy state of the completely condensed F-POSS cage. The instability of the disilanol intermediate results in low overall yields of functionalized F-POSS molecules, typically in the range of 25%-35% from the starting completely condensed F-POSS starting material. 
     It would be desirable to provide an efficient, high-yield process for producing functionalized F-POSS molecules for use in materials.

The patent in question is titled Catalyst layers and electrolyzers.  The extract of text citing that article is: ds, including those available from DuPont under the trade designation Nafion, are used. Acidic polymers substantially decrease the selectivity of CO 2  electrolyzers, so they are typically not useful in practical CO 2  electrolyzers. 
     There are a few reports of anionic fuel cells with anion conducting polymers having multiple covalently attached positively charged groups in their catalyst layer. See for example U.S. Pat.

The patent in question is titled Protease resistant mutants of stromal cell derived factor-1 in the repair of tissue damage.  The extract of text citing that article is: DF-1 peptides presented above are 68 amino acids in length. However, unless otherwise indicated, it will also be understood that one additional proteinogenic amino acid may be added to the N terminus without substantially changing chemoattractant activity or MMP-2 resistance. Moreover, the addition of an amino acid at the N terminus represents a preferred embodiment since this will have the effect of making the peptide resistant to digestion by a second common peptidase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV/CD26, abbreviated herein as â€œDPPIVâ€). 
     DPPIV is a 110-kD glycoprotein which is expressed in renal proximal tubules, in intestinal epithelial cells, liver, placenta and lung and which cleaves peptides that have a proline in the second position from the N terminus (Kikawa, et al.,  Biochim. Biophys. Acta  1751:45-51 (2005)). SDF-1 has a proline in the second position (as can be seen above in SEQ ID NO:52) and is therefore cleaved by DPPIV between this proline and the following valine (Narducci, et al.,  Blood  107:1108-1115 (2006); Christopherson,  Exp. Hematol.  34:1060-1068 (2006)). 
     One way to eliminate the proteolytic effect of DPPIV would be to change the proline in position 2 of SDF-1 (see SEQ ID NO:52). However, this proline is essential for SDF-1&#39;s biological activity and therefore cannot be replaced and maintain a therapeutically effective peptide. However, activity can be maintained and a DPPIV resistant peptide made by adding one to four amino acids (or an organic group) to the N terminus of SEQ ID:52. For example, it has been experimentally found that resistance to DPPIV cleavage can be obtained by adding a serine to the N terminus of the peptide. 
     Thus, in another aspect, the invention is directed to the peptide X p -SDF-1, where X is preferably, any proteinogenic amino acid, p is an integer between 1 and 4, and SDF-1 is as shown in SEQ ID NO:52. In preferred embodiments, n=1. It will be understood that when p is greater than 1, each of the 2-4 added amino acids may independently be chosen from any of the proteinogenic amino acids desc",0.88

     Example 4: Materials and Methods for Examples 5-6 
     The experiments described in Examples 2-3 were expanded in order to advance the results obtained therefrom using the following materials and methods. For example, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) rank as the fourth most common cause for cancer related death in the world (Siegel et al. (2014)  CA Canc. J. Clin.  64:9-29). As the majority of patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, therapeutic options remain limited and the prognosis is dismal with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5% (Hidalgo (2010)  New Engl. J. Med.  362:1605-1617). The last two decades brought significant advances in the understanding of tumorigenesis and disease progression in pancreatic cancer, which can now be seen as a diverse and multifactorial neoplastic process (Hidalgo (2010)  New Engl. J. Med.  362:1605-1617; Hanahan and Weinberg (2011)  Cell  144:646-674). Pancreatic tumor tissue is composed of several distinctive, cellular and non-cellular elements including a collagen-rich, poorly vascularized and highly hypoxic, non-neoplastic stroma (Chu et al. (2007)  J. Cell. Biochem.  101:887-907; Mahadevan and Von Hoff (207)  Mol. Canc. Therapeut.  6:1186-1197). These characteristics are associated with profound chemoresistance to the most commonly used systemically applicable anti-cancer agents, such as gemcitabine (Muerkoster et al.

The patent in question is titled Tree-free fiber compositions and uses in containerboard packaging.  The extract of text citing that article is: ptus, aspen and birch. 
     This disclosure focuses on using a hybrid fiber composition obtained from pulping or bleaching of wheat straw, corn stover, kenaf, seaweed, etc., obtained by chemical, mechanical, or combined means for a corrugating medium to be used in containerboard packaging applications. This is significantly different from composite boards for construction of fiberboard, building, houses, and furniture applications. A combination of red algae, wheat straw, kenaf, corn stover, etc., pulp provides tree-free structures that display acceptable properties for the corrugated medium. 
     Pulping processes for non-wood natural fibers are raw-material-dependent; detailed steps can be found in Sridach, W. (2010), The Environmentally Benign Pulping Process of Non-wood Fibers, Suranaree J. Sci. Technol., 17(2), 105-123. For example, red algae pulp can be processed by simple bleaching steps with much less energy and capital cost, partially because there is no presence of lignin (Seo, Y. B. et al. (2010), Red Algae and Their Use in Papermaking, Bioresource Technology, 101, 2549-2553). 
     Use of alternative non-wood natural fibers such as using field crop fibers and agricultural residues instead of wood fibers is considered more sustainable, due in part to the classification of these materials as by-products of or waste from other processes. Suppliers can pay customers to help them dispose of these materials. Examples of such raw natural materials are kenaf, flax, bamboo, cotton, jute, hemp, sisal, bagasse, corn stover, rice straw, wheat straw, hesperaloe, switchgrass, reed, arundo donax, marine or fresh water algae/seaweeds, or aquatic plants such as water hyacinth. Non-wood fiber sources account for only about 5-10% of global pulp production for a variety of reasons including seasonal availability, problems with chemical recovery, brightness of the pulp, silica content, etc.

The patent in question is titled ST2 antigen binding proteins.  The extract of text citing that article is: cells transformed with the recombinant expression vector, and allowing the expressed fusion protein to assemble much like antibody molecules, whereupon interchain disulfide bonds form between the Fc moieties to yield the dimer. 
     The term â€œFc polypeptideâ€ as used herein includes native and mutein forms of polypeptides derived from the Fc region of an antibody. Truncated forms of such polypeptides containing the hinge region that promotes dimerization also are included. Fusion proteins comprising Fc moieties (and oligomers formed therefrom) offer the advantage of facile purification by affinity chromatography over Protein A or Protein G columns. 
     One suitable Fc polypeptide, described in PCT application WO 93/10151 (hereby incorporated by reference), is a single chain polypeptide extending from the N-terminal hinge region to the native C-terminus of the Fc region of a human IgG antibody. Another useful Fc polypeptide is the Fc mutein described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,457,035 and in Baum et al., 1994 , EMBO J.  13:3992-4001. The amino acid sequence of this mutein is identical to that of the native Fc sequence presented in WO 93/10151, except that amino acid 19 has been changed from Leu to Ala, amino acid 20 has been changed from Leu to Glu, and amino acid 22 has been changed from Gly to Ala. The mutein exhibits reduced affinity for Fc receptors. 
     In other embodiments, the variable portion of the heavy and/or light chains of a ST2 antibody may be substituted for the variable portion of an antibody heavy and/or light chain. 
     Another method for preparing oligomeric ST2 antibody derivatives involves use of a leucine zipper. Leucine zipper domains are peptides that promote oligomerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA-binding proteins (Landschulz et al., 1988 , Science  240:1759), and have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides an",0.91

The patent in question is titled Process for making modulators of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.  The extract of text citing that article is: ion causing an imbalance in ion and fluid transport. The resulting decrease in anion transport contributes to enhanced mucus accumulation in the lung and the accompanying microbial infections that ultimately cause death in CF patients. In addition to respiratory disease, CF patients typically suffer from gastrointestinal problems and pancreatic insufficiency that, if left untreated, results in death. In addition, the majority of males with cystic fibrosis are infertile and fertility is decreased among females with cystic fibrosis. In contrast to the severe effects of two copies of the CF associated gene, individuals with a single copy of the CF associated gene exhibit increased resistance to cholera and to dehydration resulting from diarrheaâ€”perhaps explaining the relatively high frequency of the CF gene within the population. 
     Sequence analysis of the CFTR gene of CF chromosomes has revealed a variety of disease causing mutations (Cutting, G. R. et al. (1990) Nature 346:366-369; Dean, M. et al. (1990) Cell 61:863:870; and Kerem, B-S. et al. (1989) Science 245:1073-1080; Kerem, B-S et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:8447-8451). To date, greater than 1000 disease causing mutations in the CF gene have been identified (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/app). The most prevalent mutation is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 of the CFTR amino acid sequence, and is commonly referred to as Î”F508-CFTR. This mutation occurs in approximately 70% of the cases of cystic fibrosis and is associated with a severe disease. 
     The deletion of residue 508 in Î”F508-CFTR prevents the nascent protein from folding correctly. This results in the inability of the mutant protein to exit the ER, and traffic to the plasma membrane. As a result, the number of channels present in the membrane is far less than observed in cells expressing wild-type CFTR. In addition to impaired trafficking, the mutation results in defective channel gating. Together, the reduced number of channels in the membrane and the defective gating lead to reduced anion transport across epithelia leading to d",0.04

     Attempts to control solution properties through electrochemical agents attached to the surface have been described. Electrochemically triggered release of biotin from a modified gold electrode surface via reduction and subsequent lactonization of quinone tether was demonstrated (Hodneland et al., â€œBiomolecular surfaces that release ligands under electrochemical control,â€ J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122, pp. 4235-36 (2000)). Electrochemical control of self-assembly and release of antibodies from the surface into solution was achieved by reduction and oxidation of n-decanethiol-benzoquinones (Artzy-Schnirman et al., â€œArtzy-Schnirman et al., Nano Lett. 2008, 8:3398-3403,â€ Nano Lett.  8 , pp. 3398-3403 (2008)).

Cancer Ther.  2012; 11; 2254-2264; Song et. al.,  Mol. Cancer Ther.  2011; 10; 481-494). Inactivation of negative regulatory proteins, such as the SOCS (suppressors of cytokine signalling) or PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STATs) proteins have also been shown to influence the activation status of the JAK/STAT signalling pathway in cancer (Mottok et al.,  Blood  2007; 110; 3387-90; Ogata et al.,  Gastroenterology  2006; 131; 179-193., Lee et al.,  Mol.

     In addition to basal activation of JAK1/STAT3 signaling in multiple human tumors, the pathway has also been shown to be activated as a feedback resistance mechanism in response to inhibition of driver oncogenic pathways in cancer cells, such as the mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or the MAPK pathway in KRAS mutant tumors (Lee et al.,  Cancer Cell  2014; 26; 207-221; VanSchaeybroeck et al.,  Cell reports  2014; 7; 1940-1955). Thus inhibition of JAK1 may provide a means of potentiating the therapeutic benefit of a variety of targeted cancer therapies. 
     Also, cancer cachexia is a significant contributor to increased mortality and poor response to chemotherapy in patients with advanced cancer. Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, which signal through the JAK/STAT pathway have been shown to play a causal role, indicating the potential benefit of JAK1 inhibition in ameliorating cancer cachexia. 
     Based on the critical role JAK1 plays in signal transduction mediated by class II cytokine receptors, the Î³ c  receptor subunit, the gp130 subunit and G-CSF, as well as its dominance in driving the activity of the immune-relevant Î³ c  cytokines, JAK1 inhibition may be useful in treating a number of immune disorders, such as bone marrow disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn&#39;s disease, lupus and multiple sclerosis.

     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     Pim kinases are family of three highly-related serine and threonine protein kinases encoded by the genes Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3. The gene names are derived from the phrase Proviral Insertion, Moloney, frequent integration sites for murine moloney virus wherein the insertions lead to overexpression of Pim kinases and either de novo T-cell lymphomas, or dramatic acceleration of tumorigenesis in a transgenic Myc-driven lymphoma model (Cuypers et al. (1984) Cell, vol. 37 (1) pp. 141-50; Selten et al. (1985) EMBO J. vol. 4 (7) pp. 1793-8; van der Lugt et al. (1995) EMBO J. vol. 14 (11) pp. 2536-44; Mikkers et al. (2002) Nature Genetics, vol. 32 (1) pp. 153-9; van Lohuizen et al. (1991) Cell, vol. 65 (5) pp. 737-52). These experiments reveal synergy with the oncogene c-Myc, and suggest that inhibition of the Pim kinases may have therapeutic benefit. 
     Mouse genetics suggests that antagonizing Pim kinases may have an acceptable safety profile; a Pim 1âˆ’/âˆ’; Pim-2âˆ’/âˆ’, Pim-3âˆ’/âˆ’ mouse knockout is viable although slightly smaller than wild type littermates (Mikkers et al. (2004) Mol Cell Biol vol. 24 (13) pp. 6104-154). The three genes give rise to six protein isoforms including a protein kinase domain, and apparently without recognizable regulatory domains. All six isoforms are constitutively active protein kinases that do not require post-translational modification for activity, thus Pim kinases are regulated primarily at the transcriptional level (Qian et al. (2005) J Biol Chem, vol. 280 ",0.0

     Salicylic acid, an organic Î²-hydroxy acid, traditionally used as an antithrombogenic agent, has been recently shown to affect bacterial infection and virulence. In endocarditis,  Staphylococcus aureus  causes endovascular infections, damaging endothelial cells of valvular tissue. Salicylic acid appears to mitigate the virulent effects, reducing growth and cellular density of  S. aureus -induced infective endocarditis in an animal model (Kupferwasser et al., 1999 â€œAcetylsalicylic Acid Reduces Vegetation Bacterial Density, Hematogenous Bacterial Dissemination, and Frequency of Embolic Events in Experimental  Staphylococcus aureus  Endocarditis Through Antiplatelet and Antibacterial Effects,â€ Circulation, 99:2791-2797; Kupferwasser et al., â€œSalicylic acid attenuates virulence in endovascular infections by targeting global regulatory pathways in  Staphylococcus aureus ,â€ J Clin Invest. 2003; 112(2):222-33). In fact, salicylic acid modulates virulence by suppressing expression of adherence factors (Kupferwasser et al., â€œSalicylic acid attenuates virulence in endovascular infections by targeting global regulatory pathways in  Staphylococcus aureus ,â€ J Clin Invest. 2003; 112(2):222-33).

     Evidence for a role for Btk in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases has also been provided by Btk-deficient mouse models. In preclinical murine models of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Btk-deficient mice show marked amelioration of disease progression. In addition, Btk-deficient mice are resistant to collagen-induced arthritis (Jails son and Holmdahl  Clin. Exp. Immunol.  1993 94:459). A selective Btk inhibitor has demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in a mouse arthritis model (Z. Pan et al.,  Chem. Med Chem.  2007 2:58-61). 
     Btk is also expressed by cells other than B-cells that may be involved in disease processes. For example, Btk is expressed by mast cells and Btk-deficient bone marrow-derived mast cells demonstrate impaired antigen-induced degranulation (Iwaki et al.  J. Biol. Chem.  2005 280:40261). This shows that Btk could be useful to treat pathological mast cells responses such as allergy and asthma. Also monocytes from XLA patients, in which Btk activity is absent, show decreased TNF alpha production following stimulation (Horwood et al.  J. Exp. Med.  2003 197:1603). Therefore TNF alpha-mediated inflammation could be modulated by small molecular Btk inhibitors. Also, Btk has been reported to play a role in apoptosis (Islam and Smith  Immunol. Rev.  2000 178:49) and thus Btk inhibitors would be useful for the treatment of certain B-cell lymphomas and leukemias (Feldhahn et al.  J. Exp. Med.  2005 201:1837).

The patent in question is titled Sodium channel blockers for skin disorders.  The extract of text citing that article is: c subunits. 
     ENaCs mediate Na +  transport across apical or luminal membranes, providing the rate-limiting step of transepithelial Na +  uptake. ENaCs are expressed in many salt-reabsorbing epithelia, including the renal distal nephron, airway, and colon. ENaC-mediated Na +  absorption in the distal nephron has an essential role in extracellular volume homeostasis and blood pressure regulation, while Na +  absorption in the airway has a key role in regulating airway surface liquid volume and the rate of mucus transport. 
     In the epidermis, keratinocytes express amiloride-sensitive ENaCs which has been demonstrated to be required for normal barrier function. Systemic genetic depletion of Î±-ENaC in mice has been shown to disrupt the formation of then normal skin barrier, highlighting the importance of ENaC in the epidermis. Furthermore, ENaC-mediated sodium flux in keratinocytes increases the secretion of inflammatory cytokines via the COX-2/prostaglandin E 2  (PGE 2 ) pathway (Charles, R.-P., Guitard, M., Leyvraz, C., Breiden, B., Haftek, M., Haftek-Terreau, Z., Hummler, E. (2008). Postnatal requirement of the epithelial sodium channel for maintenance of epidermal barrier function.  The Journal of Biological Chemistry,  283(5), 2622-30). The role of ENaC as an upstream mediator of prostaglandin E 2  release has been further confirmed in the uterine endometrium, where ENaC is required for embryo implantation. (Ruan, Y. C., Guo, J. H., Liu, X., Zhang, R., Tsang, L. L., Dong, J. Da, Chan, H. C. (2012). Activation of the epithelial Na+ channel triggers prostaglandin E 2  release and production required for embryo implantation.  Nature Medicine,  18(7), 1112-7). As such, the inhibition of ENaC in keratinocytes has been proposed to promote healing of the skin via multiple processes that may include changes in keratinocyte differentiation, proliferation, and inflammatory signaling.

     Inhibition of Crm1 blocks the exodus of tumor suppressor proteins and/or growth regulators such as p53, c-Abl, p21, p27, pRB, BRCA1, IkB, ICp27, E2F4, KLF5, YAP1, ZAP, KLF5, HDAC4, HDAC5 or forkhead proteins (e.g. FOXO3a) from the nucleus that are associated with gene expression, cell proliferation, angiogenesis and epigenetics. Crm1 inhibitors have been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells even in the presence of activating oncogenic or growth stimulating signals, while sparing normal (untransformed) cells. Most studies of Crm1 inhibition have utilized the natural product Crm1 inhibitor Leptomycin B (LMB). LMB itself is highly toxic to neoplastic cells, but poorly tolerated with marked gastrointestinal toxicity in animals (Roberts et al, 1986) and humans (Newlands et al, 1996). Derivatization of LMB to improve drug-like properties leads to compounds that retain antitumor activity and are better tolerated in animal tumor models (Yang et al, 2007, Yang et al, 2008, Mutka et al, 2009). Therefore, nuclear export inhibitors could have beneficial effects in neoplastic and other proliferative disorders. To date, however, small-molecule, drug-like Crm1 inhibitors for use in vitro and in vivo are uncommon. 
     In addition to tumor suppressor proteins, Crm1 also exports several key proteins that are involved in many inflammatory processes. These include IkB, NF-kB, Cox-2, RXRÎ±, Commd1, HIF1, HMGB1, FOXO, FOXP and others. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB/rel) family of transcriptional activators, named for the discovery that it drives immunoglobulin kappa gene expression, regulate the mRNA expression of variety of genes involved in inflammation, proliferation, immunity and cell survival. Under basal conditions, a protein inhibitor of NF-kB, called IkB, binds to NF-kB in the nucleus and the complex IkB-NF-kB renders the NF-kB transcriptional function inactive. In response to inflammatory stimuli, IkB dissociates from the IkB-NF-kB complex, which releases NF-kB and unmas",0.92

     Diagnosis of micronutrient deficiency is especially needed in remote areas with limited access to power and other resources. Low-cost portable tests tend to have low resolution, impeding measurement accuracy. High quality quantitative tests require samples to be collected and sent to a facility with the appropriate instruments. A wait time of about one month is common. 
     Microfluidic measurement devices have gained popularity as low-cost, point-of-care, and rapid diagnostic tools (Hu et al., Biosensors and Bioelectronics 2014, 54, 585-597; Martinez et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2007, 46, 1318-1320). Scientists are developing microfluidic measurement devices for a wide range of functions, from rapid point-of-care measurement of liver enzyme levels to routine evaluation of heavy metal contamination in reservoir water (Pollock et al., PLoS ONE 2013, 8, e75616; Wang et al. 2014, Anal Bioanal Chem 406, 2799-2807). Many microfluidic measurement devices use either chemical reactions or antigen-antibody binding to produce a color change that correlates with the target analyte concentration (Hu et al., Biosensors and Bioelectronics 2014, 54, 585-597). Unlike their lateral flow assay (LFA) predecessors, these devices are often highly multiplexed with complex geometries and multi-color readouts. Moreover, color change may depend on time, temperature and humidity (Pollock et al., PLoS ONE 2013, 8, e75616). Together, these complexities make it difficult for a user to visually interpret the color change and accurately assign concentration values. 
     The increasing complexity of microfluidic measurement devices necessitates the development of novel methods for data acquisition and management to maintain assay objectivity and obtain quantitative measurements. Though several methods exist to read colorimetric assays, various constraints limit their utility. Line scan ",0.95

The patent in question is titled Oxabicycloheptanes and oxabicycloheptenes for the treatment of depressive and stress disorders.  The extract of text citing that article is: y, no modifications were found in the postsynaptic strength of AMPA or NMDA-mediated transmission nor subunit composition as AMPA/NMDA ratios and rectification index were comparable among experimental groups ( FIG. S1A ). To determine potential FsE-induced modifications in the efficacy of presynaptic neurotransmitter release, evoked transmission was examined placing a stimulating electrode in the stria medullaris. To probe presynaptic function, evoked E/IPSCs were examined with trains at high frequency (10 stimuli delivered at 20 Hz) (Zucker and Regehr, 2002). It was found that at both excitatory and inhibitory trains of synaptic responses were comparable in slices between control and FsE mice ( FIG. S1B ). 
     GIRK channels hyperpolarize neurons in response to activation of GABAB receptors, thereby providing a fine control of neuronal excitability (Luscher and Slesinger, 2010). Plasticity of GABAB-GIRK signaling is critical for specific behavioral adaptations (Hearing et al., 2013; Padgett et al., 2012). However the functional relevance of GABAB-GIRK signaling in LHb remains understudied. Bath application of a saturating dose of the GABAB-R agonist baclofen (100 Î¼M) evoked an outward current (IBaclofen) that showed little desensitization during continuous drug application ( FIG. S2A ). The outward response was readily reversed by the GABAB-R antagonist CGP54626 (10 Î¼M;  FIGS. S2A  &amp; E). Baclofen produced outward responses in a dosedependent manner, with an EC50 of 10.2 Î¼M ( FIG. S2B ). I-Baclofen correlated with a decrease in input resistance ( FIG. S2C ) consistently with activation of K+ conductance. Accordingly, I-Baclofen was abolished in presence of low barium (Ba2+) concentrations (1 mM) indicating that inwardly rectifying K+ channels are likely the effectors of GABAB activation in the LHb ( FIG. S2D ). The LHb of mice were microdissected, and whole tissue real-time PCR was performed. It was found that GIRK1-4 subunits were expressed in the LHb, supporting a functional GAB",0.56

The corrected secondary signal after 15 minutes of detection antibody incubation was measured as a net shift for each IL-2 and IL-4 standard and unknown, with the signal from each ring serving as an independent measure of IL-2 and IL-4 concentration. The average corrected secondary shift was plotted against concentration to obtain a calibration plot, which was then fit with a quadratic regression for quantitation of unknowns by inverse regression. 
     Jurkat Cell Culture, Stimulation, and Secretion Profiling 
     Jurkat T lymphocytes were passaged into fresh media at 106 cell/mL (10 mL culture in each of two T25 vented flasks). One flask was immediately stimulated to secrete IL-2 and IL-4 by adding the mitogens PMA (50 ng/mL) and PHA (2 Î¼g/mL) using an established procedure (Gebert, B.; Fischer, W.; Weiss, E.; Hoffmann, R.; Haas, R.

The extract of text citing that article is:  elutes at 16.2 min was converted into another peak at 9.4 min and a few minor peptide peaks. Thus, it was important to find out structures of the metabolites of SP-304 produced after digestion with SIF. SP-304 peptide was incubated with SIF for various times and the peptide digestion products were isolated and subjected to structure elucidation by MS analysis. 
       FIG. 3  is a schematic representation of the possible metabolites of SP-304. The major degradation products involve N and D clipped from the N-terminus and L from the C-terminus of SP304. However, there was only 30% reduction in biological activity, implying that one or more of the degradation products were also biologically active. To address this possibility, several truncated peptides were synthesized and evaluated for their abilities to stimulate cGMP synthesis in T84 cells ( FIG. 4 ). 
       FIG. 4  shows data from the analyses of various peptides in the T84 cell cGMP stimulation assay (essentially as described in Shailubhai, et al., Cancer Research 60, 5151-5157 (2000). Briefly, confluent monolayers of T-84 cells in 24-well plates were washed twice with 250 Î¼l of DMEM containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and pre-incubated at 37Â° C. for 10 minutes with 250 Î¼l of DMEM containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and 1 mM isobutyl methylxanthine (IBMX). Monolayers of T84 cells were then incubated with 250 Î¼l of DMEM containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) containing one of the peptides shown in the  FIG. 4  at a concentration of 1.0 Î¼M for 30 min. After the 30 min incubation, the medium was aspirated and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 3% perchloric acid. Following centrifugation and the addition of NaOH (0.1 N) to neutralize the pH, intracellular cGMP levels were determined in lysates using a cGMP ELISA kit (Cat. No. 581021; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Mich.). Samples were run in duplicates incubations and each sample was run as duplicates in ELISA test.

The patent in question is titled Modified biotin-binding protein fusion proteins thereof and applications.  The extract of text citing that article is: selected from any of the following, dextran, Vi polysaccharide of  Salmonella typhi , pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide, pneumococcal cell wall polysaccharide (CWPS),  meningococcal  polysaccharide,  Haemophilus influenzae  type b polysaccharide, or any another polysaccharide of viral, prokaryotic, or eukaryotic origin. 
     In some embodiments, the polysaccharide consists of or comprises an antigenic sugar moiety. For example, in some embodiments, a polysaccharide for use in the methods and immunogenic compositions as disclosed herein is a Vi polysaccharide of  Salmonella typhi . The Vi capsular polysaccharide has been developed against bacterial enteric infections, such as typhoid fever. Robbins et al., 150 J. Infect. Dis. 436 (1984); Levine et al., 7 Baillieres Clin. Gastroenterol. 501 (1993). Vi is a polymer of Î±-1â†’4-galacturonic acid with an N acetyl at position C-2 and variable O-acetylation at C-3. The virulence of  S. typhi  correlates with the expression of this molecule. Sharma et al., 101 PNAS 17492 (2004). The Vi polysaccharide vaccine of  S. typhi  has several advantages: Side effects are infrequent and mild, a single dose yields consistent immunogenicity and efficacy. Vi polysaccharide may be reliably standardized by physicochemical methods verified for other polysaccharide vaccines, Vi is stable at room temperature and it may be administered simultaneously with other vaccines without affecting immunogenicity and tolerability. Azze et al., 21 Vaccine 2758 (2003). 
     Thus, the Vi polysaccharide of  S. typhi  may be cross-linked to a first affinity molecule as disclosed herein, for attaching at least one antigen to the polysaccharide. In some embodiments, the antigen can be from the same or from another organism, such that the resulting immunogenic composition confers at least some level of immunity against one pathogen, or two different pathogens: if the antigen confers protection against pneumococcus, an immunogenic composition where the polymer scaffold is a Vi polysaccharide ca",0.62

     WHIM Syndrome 
     WHIM syndrome is a rare congenital immunodeficiency disorder characterized by main clinical manifestations: warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent bacterial infections and myelokathexis [McDermott, D H et al. Blood 118 (18): 4957-4962 (2011); Mcermott D H et al. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 15(10): 2071-2081 (2011)]. Myelokathexis can further be characterized as an unusual hematological disorder in which mature neutrophils fail to exit the bone marrow and B- and T-cell abundance or function is deficient (Zueler W W et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 270: 699-704 (1964)). Hernandez P A et al first described that mutations in the CXCR4 are associated with WHIM syndrome, wherein CXCR4 R334X  is the most common and best-studied variant (Hernandez P A et al. Nature Genetics 34: 70-74 (2003)). CXCR4 R334X , as a gain-of-function mutation, exhibits enhanced signaling capacity to the endogenous ligand CXCL12. Therefore, to tame CXCR4 R334X &#39;s increased signaling capacity may be utilized to treat WHIM syndrome. 
     In some aspects of the invention, the present invention contemplates the use of antibody-drug conjugate comprising anti-CXCR4 antibodies as the primary therapeutic composition for treatment of WHIM syndrome, wherein the said composition can contain polyclonal anti-CXCR4 or monoclonal anti-CXCR4 antibodies. Furthermore, a therapeutic composition of the present invention can contain a mixture of monoclonal anti-CXCR4 antibodies directed to different, non-blocking CXCR4 epitopes or mixture of anti-CXCR4 antibody-drug conjugates or mixture of monoclonal anti-CXCR4 and anti-CXCR4 antibody-drug conjugates.
